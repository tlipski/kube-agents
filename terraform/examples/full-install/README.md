# Full install (Terraform root composition)

A single `terraform apply` that provisions everything a running Platform Agent
needs. This composition **is** the install engine: the repository-root
`install.sh` generates its `terraform.tfvars` and drives it through
`lifecycle.sh`, and applying it by hand with your own tfvars is the same
install without the interview.

## What it provisions

- The required Google APIs (`google_project_service`, never disabled on
  destroy), including the Cloud KMS API for GKE database encryption and the Chat
  API when Google Chat is enabled.
- A GKE cluster ([`gke-cluster`](../../modules/gke-cluster) module) — Autopilot
  by default, `cluster_mode = "standard"` for an e2-standard-4 node pool
  (with an optional gVisor node pool), or `create_cluster = false` to
  install onto an existing one — with Workload Identity, Cloud KMS database
  encryption (CMEK), the Backup for GKE agent enabled, and the
  `kube-agents-host=true` discovery label applied.
- Optionally (`enable_gke_backup_plan = true`) a scheduled
  [`gke-backup-plan`](../../modules/gke-backup-plan) for the release namespace.
- The agent's GCP identity ([`kube-agents-iam`](../../modules/kube-agents-iam)
  module): the `kubeagents-platform-gsa` service account, its read-only
  project roles, and the Workload Identity binding to the
  `kubeagents-platform-agent` KSA (see
  [IAM roles](#iam-roles-permission_set-and-project_roles) below).
- Optionally (`enable_google_chat = true`) the Google Chat backend
  ([`chat-pubsub`](../../modules/chat-pubsub) module): Pub/Sub topic,
  subscription, and Chat integration wiring.
- Optionally (`enable_github_minter = true`) the GitHub token minter backend
  ([`github-minter`](../../modules/github-minter) module): minter service
  account plus a KMS key ring and signing key.
- Unless `enable_cert_manager = false`, [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io)
  via `helm_release`, pinned in `cert_manager_version`.
  It issues the serving certificate for the operator's admission
  webhooks, which this composition turns on (`enable_webhooks`, default true)
  because it can guarantee the dependency — a bare `helm install` of the chart
  cannot, and leaves them off. See [cert-manager](#cert-manager) below.
- The [`kube-agents` Helm chart](../../../charts/kube-agents) (operator +
  `PlatformAgent` CR + the LiteLLM gateway the agent's default model endpoint
  requires) via `helm_release`, installed straight from this repository
  checkout with Workload Identity annotations and the credentials Secret
  composed from your variables. `model_provider` selects which provider
  LiteLLM routes `model-default` to (set the matching `*_api_key` variable);
  `model_default_name` overrides the per-provider default model.
- Two `random_password` values added to that Secret rather than asked for:
  `SESSION_KV_API_KEY`, the bearer token for the pod-local Session KV server,
  and `SESSION_KV_SALT`, the HMAC salt that pseudonymises chat identities.
  Generated here rather than left to the chart so `terraform apply` stays
  idempotent without reading the cluster — and because rotating the salt
  re-anonymises every user, severing their past sessions from their future
  ones.
- Optionally (`model_provider = "vertex_ai"`) the Vertex AI / Model Garden path:
  a second [`kube-agents-iam`](../../modules/kube-agents-iam) instantiation for
  the gateway's service account, `roles/aiplatform.user` on
  `vertex_project_id`, and the Workload Identity annotation the chart needs.
  Vertex takes no API key, so no `*_api_key` variable applies.

> [!WARNING]
> The credential variables (`api_server_key`, `*_api_key`, Slack tokens) are
> marked `sensitive`, which redacts plan output — but like every secret passed
> through Terraform they are stored **in plaintext in the Terraform state**.
> The two generated `SESSION_KV_*` values live in state for the same reason.
> Keep the state in a protected backend (e.g. a GCS bucket with tight IAM),
> not on a shared disk or in version control.

## Prerequisites

- A GCP project you can administer.
- Terraform `~> 1.5`.
- Application Default Credentials for the Google, Kubernetes, and Helm
  providers:

  ```bash
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```

## Usage

```bash
cd terraform/examples/full-install
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # then edit it
terraform init
terraform apply
```

A first apply into an empty project needs nothing else. Once the project has
been destroyed and re-applied even once, use `make tf-apply` instead — it
adopts the Cloud KMS resources GCP refuses to delete, which a bare
`terraform apply` fails on. See [Teardown and re-apply](#teardown-and-re-apply).

### Remote state

The composition ships no backend block, so a hand-driven apply uses local
state in this directory. For an install whose state must outlive the checkout
— anything driven by `install.sh`, whose companion `uninstall.sh` and
`upgrade.sh` run from fresh clones — set `KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET` before any
`lifecycle.sh` subcommand:

```bash
KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET=auto ./lifecycle.sh apply
```

`auto` derives the bucket name `<project_id>-kube-agents-tfstate`; any other
value is used verbatim. The bucket is created on first use — versioned, with
uniform bucket-level access, in the cluster's region — and a gitignored
`backend_override.tf` points Terraform at
`gs://<bucket>/<prefix>`, where the prefix defaults to
`kube-agents/<cluster_name>` (override with `KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_PREFIX`) so two
installs in one project keep separate state. Versioning is the recovery story:
a corrupted or mistakenly-overwritten state file can be rolled back to a prior
generation by copying it over the live object (`gcloud storage ls -a` lists the
generations; `gcloud storage restore` is for soft-deleted objects, which is a
different feature — with versioning on, a previous generation is a noncurrent
version rather than a soft-deleted object):

```bash
gcloud storage ls -a gs://<bucket>/<prefix>/default.tfstate
gcloud storage cp gs://<bucket>/<prefix>/default.tfstate#<generation> \
  gs://<bucket>/<prefix>/default.tfstate
```

If the state is gone entirely,
re-run `lifecycle.sh apply` against the same tfvars — KMS adoption is
automatic, and `terraform import` covers the rest.

### Recovering from an interrupted apply

An apply killed part-way — Ctrl-C, a dropped connection, a laptop lid — leaves
state locked, and the next command fails with `Error acquiring the state lock`.
`terraform force-unlock` is the release, and it works here; what trips people up
is which identifier it wants. On the `gcs` backend the lock ID is the **GCS
generation number** of the lock object, not a UUID, and it is the `ID:` in the
error Terraform just printed:

```text
Lock Info:
  ID:        1787242876096737
  Path:      gs://<bucket>/<prefix>/default.tflock
```

```bash
terraform force-unlock 1787242876096737
```

Run it from a directory whose backend is already configured, or it will not
reach the lock at all. `force-unlock` acts on whatever backend the working
directory has, this composition ships no backend block, and `backend_override.tf`
is gitignored and written only by `lifecycle.sh` — so in a checkout that has
never been through `lifecycle.sh`, Terraform is on local state and refuses with a
local-state error that never mentions GCS. That matters here more than it looks:
`install.sh`, `uninstall.sh` and `upgrade.sh` all drive the apply from a
disposable clone, so the directory that took the lock is routinely gone by the
time anyone goes looking for it. The fix is the same one the `BackupPlan` import
below needs — `KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET=<same value> KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_PREFIX=<same value> ./lifecycle.sh adopt-kms`
first, or work in a directory `lifecycle.sh` has already initialised.

Pass a UUID from anywhere else — the `"ID"` field inside the lock object's own
JSON, for instance — and it refuses with `Lock ID should be numerical value`,
which reads like the backend not supporting `force-unlock` at all. It does.

Establish that nothing is still applying before you run it. The ID in the error
is the generation of the lock as it exists at that moment, so `force-unlock`
matches it and releases it whether the holder is a dead process or a colleague's
apply still running — the interactive confirmation is the only thing in the way,
and `-force` removes that too. What the generation check does catch is a
**stale** ID: one carried over from an earlier error, after which the lock was
released and re-taken. Pass that and the command refuses rather than breaking a
lock you were not looking at. That is the reason to prefer it to
`gcloud storage rm gs://<bucket>/<prefix>/default.tflock`, which deletes the
object whatever its generation and is the fallback for a lock whose ID you no
longer have. `<bucket>` and `<prefix>` are the ones from
[Remote state](#remote-state) — `<project_id>-kube-agents-tfstate` and
`kube-agents/<cluster_name>` unless `KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_PREFIX` overrode it.

A connectivity drop mid-apply produces two failures worth recognising, because
neither means what it looks like:

- **`http2: client connection lost` on the state upload.** Terraform retries this
  itself and the retry usually succeeds, so the run can report a state-write
  failure it then recovered from. Check the bucket before concluding state was
  lost — and remember versioning is on, so a bad write can be rolled back to the
  previous generation as above.
- **A `BackupPlan` create that fails while polling its operation.** The
  long-running operation keeps going server-side, so the plan is often `READY`
  even though Terraform recorded a failure and holds nothing in state. Check with
  `gcloud beta container backup-restore backup-plans describe`, then import it and
  re-apply rather than deleting the plan to let Terraform recreate it.

  Import into the same state the apply used, which on a remote-state install
  means the backend has to be configured first. `backend_override.tf` is
  gitignored and written only by `lifecycle.sh`, so in a checkout that has
  `terraform.tfvars` but no override — one `install.sh` wrote into and something
  later cleaned, say — a bare `terraform import` silently writes a **local**
  `terraform.tfstate`, reports success, and leaves the next apply still trying to
  create the plan. Run
  `KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET=<same value> ./lifecycle.sh adopt-kms` first — it is
  the cheapest subcommand that initialises the backend — or work in a directory
  `lifecycle.sh` has already initialised. Carry `KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_PREFIX` across
  as well if the install set one. `ensure_backend` derives the prefix
  independently of the bucket and inits with `-reconfigure`, so an omitted
  override points the backend at the default `kube-agents/<cluster_name>` object,
  and the import lands in an empty state that reports success while the real one
  still has no plan.

  `terraform.tfvars` is gitignored too, so a literally fresh clone has neither
  file and fails earlier and more loudly: `ensure_backend` evaluates
  `var.project_id` before it can write the override, and `lifecycle.sh` exits
  with "could not evaluate var.project_id". Restore the tfvars the install used
  before either recipe.

  The import itself needs the placeholder Helm provider `adopt-kms` writes for
  its own imports, and `lifecycle.sh` exposes no generic import subcommand to
  borrow — so write it yourself. `terraform import` configures every provider
  before it does anything, and the `helm` provider here is built from
  `module.gke_cluster.cluster_endpoint`; the override was needed in practice even
  with the cluster already in state. The filename suffix is what makes Terraform
  treat it as an override, so keep it:

  ```bash
  cat > providers_lifecycle_override.tf <<'EOF'
  provider "helm" {
    kubernetes = {
      host  = "https://127.0.0.1"
      token = "placeholder"
    }
  }
  EOF
  terraform import 'module.gke_backup_plan[0].google_gke_backup_backup_plan.this' \
    "projects/<project>/locations/<region>/backupPlans/<cluster_name>-backup-plan"
  rm -f providers_lifecycle_override.tf
  ```

  Remove the override before the next apply — it is never meant to survive an
  import, which is why `lifecycle.sh` deletes it on an `EXIT` trap.

### The `image_tag` rule

`image_tag` (default `latest`) overrides both the operator and platform-agent
image tags. It exists because the chart is installed from this checkout, and a
checkout's `Chart.yaml` carries an `appVersion` placeholder that never matches
a published image tag — so the chart's usual tag defaulting cannot work here
(see the [chart README](../../../charts/kube-agents/README.md)). `latest` is
fine for evaluation; pin an `X.Y.Z` release tag for production.

### Installing from a mirrored registry

For a cluster that may only pull from an approved registry, copy the images
there first — `make mirror-images MIRROR_PREFIX=<prefix> IMAGE_TAG=<tag>` from
the repository root, driven by `images.json` — then set `image_registry` to the
same prefix. It reaches the two images the chart never renders as well (the
agent Deployment and the fluent-bit sidecar the operator resolves at reconcile
time); the [chart README](../../../charts/kube-agents/README.md) explains how.
Add `third_party_image_registry` only if the mirror keeps LiteLLM and
fluent-bit under a different path.

`IMAGE_TAG` is not optional here. The four first-party images take whatever tag
the mirror step was given (`latest` if it was given none), while Terraform asks
for `image_tag` — so a mirror populated at `latest` against an `image_tag` of
`v1.2.3` holds no reference the install will ever request. `terraform apply`
reports success and the pods sit in ImagePullBackOff. Pass the same value to
both.

A mirror the nodes cannot read on their own — Harbor or Artifactory with token
auth, rather than an Artifact Registry in the same project — needs
`image_pull_secrets` as well. It takes Secret names, and the Secrets are
referenced rather than created, which is what keeps registry credentials out of
Terraform state. Create them before applying, and create the namespace first:
`create_namespace = true` on the release means Helm has not made it yet.

```bash
kubectl create namespace kubeagents-system
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
  --namespace kubeagents-system \
  --docker-server=harbor.example.com \
  --docker-username=robot\$kube-agents \
  --docker-password="$TOKEN"
```

Both are idempotent against what Helm then finds. The names reach every pod the
chart renders and, through `IMAGE_PULL_SECRETS` on the operator and
`spec.deployment.imagePullSecrets` on the `PlatformAgent`, the agent pods the
operator renders too.

**cert-manager images follow the same prefix, but not the same credentials.**
`helm_release.cert_manager` is a separate release of an upstream chart and
never sees the `helm_release.kube_agents` values, but the composition passes
it the same registry through its own image overrides
(`local.cert_manager_mirror_values`), so its five images
(`cert-manager-controller`, `-cainjector`, `-webhook`, `-acmesolver`,
`-startupapicheck`) are pulled as `<prefix>/<name>:<tag>` — the layout
`make mirror-images` writes from `images.json`, which carries all five
entries. `image_pull_secrets` does **not** reach it, so a mirror that needs
credentials means installing cert-manager yourself (below). Also not covered
is the chart itself: it is fetched over the network from
`https://charts.jetstack.io`, which an air-gapped runner cannot
reach at all. On such a runner, set `enable_cert_manager = false` and install
cert-manager yourself from the mirror before applying. `enable_webhooks`
needs cert-manager present either way; the composition's `depends_on` only
orders the release it manages, so with `enable_cert_manager = false` it is on
you to have cert-manager serving first.

### IAM roles (`permission_set` and `project_roles`)

`permission_set` names one of the agent's GCP IAM role bundles (the same
vocabulary the installer's `--permission-set` flag uses):

| `permission_set`      | Roles granted                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read-only` (default) | `local.read_only_roles` in [`main.tf`](main.tf)         |
| `custom`              | whatever `project_roles` lists — setting it is required |

There is no admin bundle. `roles/container.admin` authorizes the agent
through IAM regardless of its Kubernetes RBAC, and the
`container.clusters.impersonate` it carries applies to every cluster in the
project, so it is not something a one-word setting should hand out; see
[Security & IAM](../../../docs/site/src/content/docs/reference/security-and-iam.md).
Widening access means naming the roles in `project_roles`, where the grant
is explicit and reviewed.

The list lives in [`main.tf`](main.tf); read it there rather than from this
page.

`project_roles` still wins when set, whatever `permission_set` says, so an
existing configuration keeps the roles it had. `project_roles = []` grants
nothing and leaves IAM to you (the agent fails every GCP call until an
equivalent set exists). Deliberately no admin list is pre-staged in
`terraform.tfvars.example` — widening access should be an explicit, reviewed
choice.

### Backups

`enable_backup_agent` (default `true`) turns on the Backup for GKE addon. It
costs nothing on its own. `enable_gke_backup_plan = true` then adds the
scheduled plan — opt-in, because backups are billed per backed-up pod and per
GB of snapshot storage.

Backups include Kubernetes Secrets and persistent volume data, so the agent's
credentials are inside every snapshot: restrict backup/restore IAM to
administrators already allowed to read them, and set `backup_encryption_key`
for CMEK.

Turning the plan back off is not symmetric with turning it on: a BackupPlan
cannot be deleted while it still owns backups, so `terraform destroy` — and
setting `enable_gke_backup_plan = false` again, and changing
`backup_encryption_key` — fails on that resource until the backups are purged.
`make tf-destroy` purges them for you; the
[module README](../../modules/gke-backup-plan/README.md#teardown-is-not-symmetric)
has the commands for the other two cases, which nothing automates.

### cert-manager

The operator's admission webhooks — defaulting, validation, and the
delete-protection tripwire on the `PlatformAgent` CR — need a serving
certificate, and cert-manager is what issues it. `enable_cert_manager`
(default `true`) installs it as its own `helm_release` at
`cert_manager_version`;
`enable_webhooks` (default `true`) then turns the webhooks on in the chart.

Three behaviours are worth knowing:

- **This is not idempotent against an existing install.** install.sh probes an
  existing cluster for a `cert-manager` Deployment in the `cert-manager`
  namespace and turns this off when it finds one; a hand-written tfvars does
  not get that probe, and the apply fails on the CRDs that are already there.
  Set `enable_cert_manager = false` on such a cluster — the webhooks keep
  working, they just use the cert-manager that is already installed.
- **Destroying takes the CRDs with it**, and therefore every `Certificate`,
  `Issuer`, and `ClusterIssuer` in the cluster — not only the ones this
  composition created. On any cluster that shares cert-manager with another
  workload, install it separately and set `enable_cert_manager = false`.
- **Leader election moves rather than switching off.** cert-manager's leases
  default to `kube-system`, which Autopilot restricts. This sets
  `global.leaderElection.namespace = "cert-manager"`, which clears the
  restriction without giving up the lock.

The chart's `failurePolicy` stays at its default of `Ignore` here. Helm applies
the webhook configurations before both the `Certificate` and the
`PlatformAgent` CR, so `Fail` would have the API server reject this
composition's own CR on the first apply. See the
[chart README](../../../charts/kube-agents/README.md) for switching it to
`Fail` afterwards.

### Reaching the control plane (`allow_external_dns_traffic`)

`allow_external_dns_traffic` (default `false`) is passed to the `gke-cluster`
module and decides whether the cluster's DNS-based control plane endpoint
serves traffic from outside the VPC. Set it to `true` for a cluster a Platform
Agent running elsewhere has to reach; leave it alone for a cluster that should
stay VPC-only. The default is `false` so that applying an existing root after
upgrading does not publish an endpoint on a cluster that has none — see the
[module README](../../modules/gke-cluster/README.md) for why that endpoint is
not covered by master-authorized-networks.

### Google Chat, Slack, and GitHub integrations

With `enable_google_chat = true` the composition provisions the GCP backend
(topic, subscription, IAM) **and** enables the CR's `googleChat` integration
with the created topic/subscription — restrict access with
`google_chat_allowed_users` (empty = everyone).

With `enable_github_minter = true`, set `github_repo` to your primary GitOps repository (in `owner/repo` or GitHub URL format). Additional GitOps repositories within the same organization can also be registered in the ConfigMap by cluster administrators.

`enable_slack = true` writes `slack_bot_token` / `slack_app_token` into the
credentials Secret and turns on the CR's `slack` section, the same pair
install.sh collects. Slack needs no GCP resources, so this is
purely configuration — the Slack app itself is a manual step (below).

**Manual steps that no IaC can perform** — canonical walkthrough:
[INSTALL.md § Enable Google Chat & Slack Integrations](../../../INSTALL.md#step-4-enable-google-chat--slack-integrations-manual-required-steps):

- **Google Chat:** register the Chat app on the Chat API configuration page —
  select Cloud Pub/Sub and enter the created topic (the `chat_topic_name`
  output, as `projects/<project>/topics/<topic>`), set visibility, and verify
  a **Service account email** appears under Connection settings after saving
  (if it stays blank, Chat silently delivers no events). Then DM the bot; on
  first contact, optionally approve the pairing code via
  `hermes pairing approve google_chat <CODE>` in the gateway pod.
- **Slack:** in the Slack app console enable Socket Mode and grant the bot
  scopes listed in the walkthrough, then pass the resulting tokens as
  `slack_bot_token` / `slack_app_token`; pairing approval works the same way
  (`hermes pairing approve slack <CODE>`).

## Standalone use outside this repository

This example sources the modules by relative path because it lives in the same
repository. A standalone consumer would pin a release instead:

```hcl
module "gke_cluster" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents.git//terraform/modules/gke-cluster?ref=1.2.0"
  # ...
}
```

(and likewise for `kube-agents-iam`, `chat-pubsub`, `github-minter`, and
`gke-backup-plan`), and
would install the chart from the OCI registry rather than a local path — see
the [chart README](../../../charts/kube-agents/README.md).

## Teardown and re-apply

Use `lifecycle.sh destroy` for teardown; anything that mutates the
Terraform-managed resources out of band (for instance removing the
`kube-agents-host` label by hand) causes plan drift the next apply reverts.

Four things in this stack are not symmetric — applying them is not the inverse
of destroying them — and each one breaks a plain `terraform destroy`, or the
`terraform apply` that follows it. [`lifecycle.sh`](lifecycle.sh) handles all
four, so the cycle is repeatable:

```bash
make tf-destroy     # or: ./terraform/examples/full-install/lifecycle.sh destroy
make tf-apply       # or: ./terraform/examples/full-install/lifecycle.sh apply
```

What each one does that raw Terraform cannot:

| Asymmetry                                                            | Handled by                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| KMS key rings and keys can never be deleted, so the next apply 409s  | `tf-apply` imports the survivors before applying (`lifecycle.sh adopt-kms`)   |
| The `PlatformAgent` finalizer strands the CR and hangs the namespace | `tf-destroy` deletes the CR and waits, force-clearing the finalizer if wedged |
| A `BackupPlan` cannot be deleted while it owns backups               | `tf-destroy` purges the plan's backups first                                  |
| `deletion_protection = true` cannot be overridden by a destroy alone | `tf-destroy` applies it as `false`, then destroys                             |

The chart also carries a `pre-delete` hook that removes the CR and waits for
its finalizer, so a plain `helm uninstall` is safe on its own; `tf-destroy`
does it up front anyway, which turns the hook into a no-op. Disable it with
`platformAgent.cleanupHook.enabled=false`.

Running `terraform destroy` directly still works, but you own the four steps
above yourself — starting with `kubectl delete platformagent <name> -n
kubeagents-system --wait` while the operator is still running, and setting
`deletion_protection = false` and applying before the cluster can be removed.

> [!WARNING]
