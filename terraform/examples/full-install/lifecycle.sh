# Makes `apply` and `destroy` repeatable for this composition.
#
# Four things in this stack are not symmetric — applying them is not the inverse
# of destroying them — and every one of them turns the second `terraform apply`
# of a project's life into a failure. Terraform cannot express any of them, so
# they live here rather than in a README telling you to remember them:
#
#   1. Cloud KMS key rings and crypto keys CANNOT be deleted, ever. `terraform
#      destroy` drops them from state and leaves them in the project, so the next
#      apply fails with a 409 — and worse, destroying the crypto key SCHEDULES ITS
#      VERSIONS for destruction, so even an imported key cannot encrypt and the
#      cluster refuses to come back. `destroy` forgets them from state first so
#      Terraform never touches them; `adopt-kms` imports them back and restores
#      any version a bare `terraform destroy` already scheduled.
#   2. The PlatformAgent CR carries a finalizer only the operator can clear, and
#      `terraform destroy` removes the CR and the operator together. The chart's
#      pre-delete hook handles the ordinary case; this deletes the CR up front so
#      the hook is a fast no-op, and force-clears the finalizer if the operator is
#      already gone or wedged.
#   3. A GKE BackupPlan cannot be deleted while it still owns backups.
#   4. The cluster is created with deletion_protection = true, which a destroy
#      cannot override on its own — the attribute has to be applied as false first.
#
# Usage:
#   ./lifecycle.sh apply    [extra terraform args...]
#   ./lifecycle.sh destroy  [extra terraform args...]
#   ./lifecycle.sh adopt-kms
#
# Remote state (opt-in): set KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_BUCKET to a GCS bucket name, or
# to "auto" for <project_id>-kube-agents-tfstate. The bucket is created if
# missing (versioned, uniform access) and a gitignored backend_override.tf
# points Terraform at gs://<bucket>/<KUBE_AGENTS_STATE_PREFIX, default
# kube-agents/<cluster_name>>. Unset, state stays local as before.
