    GKE clusters to provision a scoped reader service account for -- one account

    A non-empty list does two things. It provisions the accounts, and it arms
    the credential broker: the mapping reaches the PlatformAgent CR, and a
    request naming a cluster that is not in this list is then refused rather
    than served by a wider credential.

    The default is empty because a pool member holds no IAM grant. The IAM
    Condition that scoped it grants nothing for Kubernetes object operations
    (measured 2026-08-12), and un-conditioned the same binding is project-wide
    container.viewer, so both are gone -- see the kube-agents-iam module's
    scoped_pool.tf. An armed pool therefore selects a powerless identity for
    every request and turns every cluster read into a Forbidden. Set this to
    exercise the selection, refusal and minting path; the authority arrives with
    per-cluster RBAC.

    Name each cluster by value rather than from module.gke_cluster's outputs,
    including this composition's own: the accounts would otherwise depend on the
    cluster existing and Terraform would refuse to plan the IAM until after it
