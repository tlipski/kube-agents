# Pull-request workflow mechanics

**Scope:** The commands for getting a branch from "about to start" to "merged" in this repository —
finding work already in flight, measuring drift from `main`, validating locally, working the
automated review, the labels Tide merges on, and whose move it is at any point in between.

**Owns:** the mechanics. Every _requirement_ — that you scan for duplicate work, run the pre-PR
review passes, live-test the change, resolve every thread — is stated in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and stays there. This page is what you open at the moment you carry one
out. When the two disagree, `AGENTS.md` is right and this page needs fixing.

A rule about how to run a command correctly can sit here rather than in `AGENTS.md`, because it
means nothing until you have the command in front of you — that a contributor on a fork cannot
self-assign an issue is the example. The test is when a rule has to fire, though, not how
procedural it sounds: that a draft is not in the review queue reads like mechanics, but it has to
reach an agent before it decides to wait, so `AGENTS.md` states it and only the measurement behind
it is here. `AGENTS.md` is loaded into every session and this page is not, so anything that has to
fire before an agent thinks to open a link belongs on that side of the line, not this one.

The split is by form, not by topic: this page owns the mechanics that are commands, and
[`.agents/rules/`](../.agents/rules/) owns the ones that are prose. `AGENTS.md` had no budget left
to hold prose mechanics itself, so the pre-PR passes' went to
[`.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md`](../.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md) and the workflow-authoring
rules' to [`.agents/rules/github_actions.md`](../.agents/rules/github_actions.md). A mechanic with
no command in it goes there rather than here, whichever rule it serves.

Related: [`.agents/skills/review-preflight/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/review-preflight/SKILL.md)
owns the pre-PR review plumbing,
[`.agents/rules/`](../.agents/rules/) owns the rules an agent follows by family, and
[`.claude/commands/pr-review-batch.md`](../.claude/commands/pr-review-batch.md) owns the mechanics of
reviewing somebody else's pull request.

## Check whether someone is already doing it

`AGENTS.md`, "Before Starting a Task", requires this scan and says what to report. Branches live on
forks, so name the upstream repository on every call:

```bash
# Open PRs, with the files each one touches. File overlap is the strongest duplicate
# signal and one call gets it for every open PR.
gh pr list --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,author,headRefName,isDraft,updatedAt,files

# Open issues, and who has already claimed them.
gh issue list --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,assignees,labels

# Already tried? A closed pull request is a decision, not an absence.
gh search prs --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --state closed --limit 20 '<keywords>'
```

Claiming an unassigned issue, once the user has agreed:

```bash
gh issue edit <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --add-assignee @me
```

`@me` is the account whose token you hold, and `AGENTS.md` is explicit that this makes it a person
you are volunteering. A contributor working from a fork without write access cannot self-assign at
all; offer a comment instead.

## Measure how far a branch has drifted from `main`

The files you are changing that `main` has also changed since you diverged — the list `AGENTS.md`
sends you here for:

```bash
# Fetch again before measuring anything. Every command below compares against the
# remote-tracking ref, and one you have not refreshed is stale in exactly the way
# this is about -- it answers "nothing has changed" for a main that has.
# The guard is for the offline case: `git diff` reports an unresolvable range on
# stderr while comm still exits 0, so a missing upstream/main prints an all-clear.
git fetch upstream main
git rev-parse --verify --quiet upstream/main >/dev/null || echo 'no upstream/main -- fetch first'

git rev-list --count HEAD..upstream/main   # how far this branch has drifted

# Files you are changing that main has also changed since you diverged. Three
# things the obvious version of this gets wrong:
#
#   - Your side has to count work that is not committed yet. Mid-branch, most of
#     what you are changing is still in the working tree, and a commit-only
#     comparison calls that case clean. `git diff HEAD` covers staged and
#     unstaged; `ls-files --others` adds files you have created but not added.
#   - --no-renames keeps both sides naming the same path. Rename detection is on
#     by default, so when main renames a file you are editing, its side reports
#     only the new path and yours only the old, and the intersection is empty.
#     Docs restructures move whole trees here, so this is not hypothetical.
#   - The two `...` ranges are in opposite orders -- your side of the fork point,
#     then main's. Do not pass the first as a pathspec to the second: a branch
#     with no commits of its own passes an empty pathspec, which git reads as no
#     filter and answers "every file main touched".
comm -12 <( { git diff --no-renames --name-only upstream/main...HEAD
              git diff --no-renames --name-only HEAD
              git ls-files --others --exclude-standard; } | sort -u ) \
         <(git diff --no-renames --name-only HEAD...upstream/main | sort)
```

`AGENTS.md` says what to do with the result. The one mechanical detail it leaves out: rebase refuses
on a dirty tree, so commit or stash before you start one.

## Local validation before committing

`AGENTS.md` names these checks; the detail is here.

**Formatting.** Run `prettier --write <files>` on changed Markdown or YAML files — `.md`, `.yaml`,
and `.yml` are the three extensions both CI and `make prettier-check` look at, so a reformatted
`.json` file is churn nothing asked for. `make prettier-check` checks all files — note that this
covers files outside your PR scope, while CI only checks the ones your branch changed. Install the version CI pins (see the Install Prettier step
in `.github/workflows/prettier.yml`), e.g. `npm install -g prettier@<that version>`: the manifests
gate in `k8s-operator-test.yml` asserts byte-equality against that version's output, so a skew fails
CI on files you did not touch. Prefer the installed binary over `npx prettier`, which re-resolves the
package against the npm registry on every run and fails outright behind an authenticated mirror —
that failure is why this step has previously been skipped rather than run.

**Docker build.** Validate the agent runner Dockerfile by building it locally:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile --target platform .
```

Keep `--platform linux/amd64`: the base images are multi-arch and deployment targets are amd64 GKE
nodes, so a bare build on an arm64 machine produces an image that cannot run on the cluster (#560).

**Image layer budget.** If you add a `RUN` or `COPY` to `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`, build the
`platform` target with `-t platform-agent:latest` and run `python3 scripts/check_image_layers.py`.
Docker's overlay2 driver stops mounting at 128 layers and `agent-base` → `platform` is the deepest
chain the file ships; the gate fails at 120, leaving a fix somewhere to go. Because buildx has no
such limit, an over-budget image passes every PR build and fails only in Cloud Build, on main,
after merge (#658). CI runs the same check in
`docker-build.yml`. The docstring in `scripts/check_image_layers.py` owns which image the gate points
at and why — read it before changing the target.

**Operator code.** If you modify `k8s-operator/`, run `make` or `go build` inside that directory to
ensure compilation succeeds.

## The automated review

`AGENTS.md`, "Automated Review After Opening a Pull Request", says what `kube-agents-bot` is, when
it runs, and what you owe its findings. This section is how you watch for one and answer it.

### How to read it

A 👀 reaction means the review started; a posted review means it finished. Across #630–#699 the 👀
landed within seconds of the trigger, and the review a median of **9 minutes** after that — 15
minutes at the 90th percentile, 45 in the slowest of the 54 reviews in that range (#634, an XXL
diff). A `/review` re-read is no quicker: median 11 minutes, and none of the 42 measured took longer
than 22. A review that runs always reports back, so a one-line "no findings" is a result, not
silence. Findings arrive as inline comments badged 🔴 High, 🟠 Medium, or 🟡 Low; findings the bot
could not anchor to a changed line appear in the summary body under **Findings outside this diff**. A
👀 with nothing following it is a bug in the bot, not a verdict — it happened to 3 of the 57 pull
requests picked up in that range (#647, #649, #679), which is rare enough to be worth waiting through
and common enough that you must not wait forever.

### Waiting for it

Poll on a schedule rather than continuously — nothing is worth checking in the first 5 minutes, then
once a minute. Expect the review by 15 minutes; at 30 with nothing posted, stop waiting and tell the
user the bot dropped this one. Nothing retries on its own, so ask whether to spend a trigger — and
say which: a review that goes missing was a first-review-width one, so `/review all` is what replaces
it, and `/review` narrows the retry to what the bot is certain of.

Two things make a wait read wrong:

- **The 👀 does not come back.** A reaction is one per user, so the eyes from the first review are
  still sitting there when you comment `/review` or mark a draft ready. Only the review list moves:
  note how many bot reviews exist _before_ you re-trigger, and wait for that count to change rather
  than for a reaction that already fired.
- **A draft is not waiting on anything.** The trigger is ready-for-review, not opened. Every
  multi-hour gap in the range above was a draft sitting unreviewed by design — #652 for 12 hours,
  #659 for 18 — and measured from the ready event each was picked up in seconds. Do not start the
  clock, or report the bot broken, while the pull request is still a draft.

Poll with:

```bash
# Both commands name gke-labs/kube-agents explicitly: PR branches live on forks,
# but the review lives on the upstream pull request.

# Has the bot reviewed yet? Takes the LAST bot review and prints its timestamp
# first: after a /review the earlier review is still there, and reading it back
# looks exactly like the new one having landed. No output = no review yet.
# (gh reports the login without the [bot] suffix; the REST API below adds it.)
gh pr view <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --json reviews \
  --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.author.login == "kube-agents-bot")] | last | select(.)
        | "\(.submittedAt)\n\(.body)"'

# The inline findings, with the comment ids needed to reply. --paginate matters:
# the default page holds 30 comments and a truncated list still looks complete.
# .line is null once a finding's line falls out of the diff, hence the fallback.
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/pulls/<number>/comments --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "kube-agents-bot[bot]")
        | "\(.path):\(.line // .original_line) [id \(.id)]\n\(.body)\n"'
```

### Replying to a finding

A finding you disagree with gets answered in its thread, not silently dropped:

```bash
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
  -f body='<the reasoning>'
```

## Resolving conversations

Reply first — `AGENTS.md` says why — naming what changed and the commit that changed it. Then
resolve:

```bash
# Every unresolved thread, with both ids you need: resolveReviewThread takes the
# thread's node id, while the reply endpoint above takes the first comment's
# databaseId. REST returns only the latter, which is why this one is GraphQL.
gh api graphql -f query='
query($pr: Int!) {
  repository(owner: "gke-labs", name: "kube-agents") {
    pullRequest(number: $pr) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id isResolved isOutdated viewerCanResolve path line
          comments(first: 20) { nodes { databaseId author { login } body } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -F pr=<number> --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
  | select(.isResolved | not)
  | "\(.path):\(.line // "outdated") thread \(.id) canResolve=\(.viewerCanResolve)
  reply to \(.comments.nodes[0].databaseId) — \(.comments.nodes[0].author.login): \(.comments.nodes[0].body | split("\n")[0])
  replies so far: \(.comments.nodes | length - 1)"'

# Per thread, once the reply naming the fix is posted:
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($thread: ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $thread}) { thread { isResolved } }
}' -f thread='<PRRT_...>'
```

Four ways that goes wrong quietly:

- `first: 100` is a cap, not a promise. A long-lived pull request can carry more threads than that;
  page for the rest, or say you only looked at the first hundred rather than reporting the branch
  clear.
- `line` is `null` once a thread's line falls out of the diff. Outdated is not addressed — the code
  moved, which says nothing about whether the finding still holds. Read the thread.
- `viewerCanResolve` is the authoritative answer to whether your token can resolve at all; it
  differs between a maintainer and a contributor pushing from a fork. Check it before you reply,
  because a mutation that fails after the reply is posted leaves a half-answered thread that looks
  handled.
- `unresolveReviewThread`, same `threadId`, is the undo. Use it the moment the user disagrees with
  something you resolved.

## How a change merges

Nobody presses Merge. This is a Prow repository: `google-oss-prow` squash-merges a pull request on
its own once Tide's query matches it, and that query wants the labels `lgtm` and `approved` both
present, with `do-not-merge`, `do-not-merge/hold`, `do-not-merge/invalid-owners-file`, and
`do-not-merge/work-in-progress` all absent. The configuration is
[`prow/oss/config.yaml`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra/blob/master/prow/oss/config.yaml)
and
[`prow/oss/plugins.yaml`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra/blob/master/prow/oss/plugins.yaml)
in `GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra` — another repository, which is why nothing here can be
authoritative about it. Read it there when the answer matters, and
[oss.gprow.dev/command-help](https://oss.gprow.dev/command-help) for the full command set.

The two labels are the two people:

- **`lgtm` is the reviewer's.** A GitHub "Approve" review sets it, and so does `/lgtm` in a comment.
  This is what the auto-requested human reviewer is being asked for. Prow does not take an `/lgtm`
  from the pull request's own author, so every change needs one other person however it is approved.
  `trusted_team_for_sticky_lgtm: Googlers` is configured, which means a push after the label lands
  strips it again unless the author is in that team, and the reviewer has to give it a second time.
- **`approved` is an `OWNERS` approver's.** `/approve`, from someone in the `OWNERS` file governing
  the changed paths — [`OWNERS`](../OWNERS) at the root, [`k8s-operator/OWNERS`](../k8s-operator/OWNERS)
  for the operator, with [`OWNERS_ALIASES`](../OWNERS_ALIASES) expanding `waw-leads`. An approver's
  "Approve" review sets both labels at once, which is why most pull requests here need exactly one
  review from one person (#1070). An approver's own pull request counts as self-approved, so a
  change from someone in `OWNERS` starts with the `approved` half already satisfied and waits only
  on the `lgtm` (#1075).

Everyone `.github/auto_request_review.yml` can assign is also an `OWNERS` approver, so the reviewer
the bot's green check summons is always someone who can clear both labels in one action. That is a
property of two lists agreeing today, not a guarantee either file makes.

Before any of that, a pull request from an author Prow does not already trust is labelled
`needs-ok-to-test`, and its Prow presubmits hold until a member comments `/ok-to-test`. It gates
Prow's jobs, not the GitHub Actions checks, so a pull request can look fully green and still be
waiting on it.

`/hold` parks an otherwise-mergeable pull request without withdrawing anything else, and
`/hold cancel` releases it — #1045 held that way for a smoke test. `/override <context>`, which only
a repository admin can use, forces a required check that cannot pass on its own.

**Branch protection is not the gate and reads as though there is none.** `main` requires six
contexts — `cla/google`, `actionlint`, `build`, `prettier`, `validate`, `Run Controller Tests` —
and conversation resolution, but **zero** approving reviews, because approval is Tide's business
rather than GitHub's. A reader who checks the repository settings for the review requirement
therefore finds nothing and concludes wrongly.

Those six are not the whole required set either. Tide also requires every Prow presubmit not marked
`optional`, and those are configured in `oss-test-infra` rather than in branch protection —
`pull-kube-agents-smoke-test` carries `optional: true`, which is why it reports on a pull request
without gating one. So the command below answers half the question, and a red check in neither list
blocks no merge:

```bash
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/branches/main/protection \
  --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'
```

**`mergeStateStatus` cannot answer "is this ready to merge" here, and it is the natural thing to
reach for.** Every open pull request reads `BLOCKED` or `DIRTY` and none ever reads `CLEAN`, because
`main` restricts pushes to the `google-oss-prow` app and GitHub scores that restriction as a block
on the querying user. #1065 read `BLOCKED` while carrying both labels and while `tide` reported
`In merge pool.` Ask Tide instead — its status on the head commit states its own reason — and
[oss.gprow.dev/tide](https://oss.gprow.dev/tide) shows the queue.

```bash
# Why Tide has not merged it: its own reason first, then the labels it wants.
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/commits/<head-sha>/status \
  --jq '.statuses[] | select(.context == "tide") | "\(.state): \(.description)"'
gh pr view <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name]'
```

## Who owns an open pull request

Every open pull request has exactly one party whose move it is, and the commonest way one sits for
a fortnight is that both sides believe it is the other's. The rule:

**The author owns it while it is blocked on them** — a draft, failing _required_ checks, merge
conflicts, unresolved review threads, changes requested, or no human reviewer requested yet.
**Otherwise the requested reviewers own it.** A past reviewer does not: an approval already given
is not an outstanding obligation. `kube-agents-bot` and other bot reviewers never count either way.

A draft is owned by its author and waited on by nobody, so it is not a backlog item — it is work in
progress, and chasing it is noise.

Four states that look like somebody else's problem and are not:

- **`CHANGES_REQUESTED` does not clear itself.** It stays set until a reviewer submits a _new_
  review. Pushing the fix does not clear it, resolving every thread does not clear it, and GitHub
  will report `CHANGES_REQUESTED` and "review requested from X" in the same breath. Re-requesting
  review is the explicit hand-back — do that rather than assuming the push spoke for itself.
- **Nobody is requested at all.** Because a human is only assigned once the `AI Review` check goes
  green, an author with outstanding bot findings has no reviewer and no notification saying so.
  Clearing the findings and commenting `/review` for a clean pass is what summons one;
  `/request-review` is the override. Answering every bot thread does not summon one by itself, so
  an author who has done everything asked of them can still be sitting with nobody assigned.
- **A red check that is not required.** It blocks no merge and is not the author's problem — but
  "required" means both lists above, not branch protection's six alone, and `tide` is what actually
  knows. Ask it before treating a failing job as work owed, and before concluding one is not.
- **`mergeable: UNKNOWN`.** GitHub computes mergeability lazily and the first query only triggers
  the job, so a conflict reads as conflict-free until you ask twice.

`skip_reason()` in [`scripts/request_reviewers.py`](../scripts/request_reviewers.py) is the same
rule in code for the one decision this repository automates — it declines to request a reviewer for
a draft, for a title carrying an ignored keyword, when someone is already requested, and when a
human other than the author has already submitted `APPROVED` or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. A periodic
triage sweep applies the wider rule and messages whoever owns each pull request; it runs outside
this repository, so the rule above is all this page can state about it.

```bash
# Whose move is it: draft, conflicts, verdict, and who is on the hook now.
gh pr view <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents \
  --json isDraft,mergeable,reviewDecision,reviewRequests \
  --jq '{draft: .isDraft, mergeable, decision: .reviewDecision,
         requested: [.reviewRequests[].login]}'
```
