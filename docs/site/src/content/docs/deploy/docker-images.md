Every image an install pulls or a rebuild needs, and how their tags are managed.

## Image inventory

[`images.json`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/images.json) at the repository root is the source of truth for this list. It is what `make mirror-images` copies from, what the chart and the dev tooling resolve their third-party pins from, and what the table below is generated from — so there is one pin per image, not one per install path.

A bump starts here but rarely ends here. Several images keep a second copy that this file is the
source for — a chart value, a Dockerfile `ARG` default, a compiled constant in the operator — and
`make images-check` is what holds them in step. It covers every image the chart renders, on both a
default and a mirrored install; the build-time bases against their Dockerfile `ARG` defaults; the
fluent-bit fallback baked into the operator binary; the example manifests; and the kustomize
integrations, which it requires to name a variable this file owns rather than a literal.

Two copies it does not reach, where a stale pin passes every check. An image behind a non-default
chart toggle is never rendered, so Hindsight (`memory.provider`) and the GitHub token minter
(`githubMinter.enabled`) keep unguarded pins in `charts/kube-agents/values.yaml`. And cert-manager's
version is set again in `terraform/examples/full-install/variables.tf`, which no check reads.

Bump the pin here, run `make images-check` and `make docs-generate`, then grep the tree for the old
version before opening the pull request.

### Pulled by an install, built elsewhere

Pinned here so `make mirror-images` and the install ask for the same version.

| Image | Upstream reference | Pin | Override | Pulled by |

### Base images

Needed only to rebuild the images above from source, not to run an install. Each is a build arg on its Dockerfile, so a mirrored rebuild passes the copy's reference.

| Image | Upstream reference | Pin | Override | Pulled by |
| ----- | ------------------ | --- | -------- | --------- |
| `hermes-agent` | `docker.io/nousresearch/hermes-agent` | `HERMES_AGENT_TAG` in [`tags.env`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/tags.env) | `HERMES_AGENT_IMAGE` | deploy/docker/Dockerfile (agent-base stage). |
| `envoy` | `docker.io/envoyproxy/envoy` | `v1.39.1` | `ENVOY_IMAGE` | deploy/docker/Dockerfile (envoy-bin stage). |
| `golang` | `docker.io/library/golang` | `1.27-alpine` | `GOLANG_IMAGE` | deploy/docker/Dockerfile and k8s-operator/Dockerfile builder stages. |

## Published images

Built and published via GitHub Actions workflows on push to `main` (tagged with commit SHA and `:latest`). Production SemVer release tags (`X.Y.Z`) are promoted from validated commit images by the release publishing workflow without rebuilding.

### `platform-agent`

The agent Deployment image. Built from the `platform` target of [`deploy/docker/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/deploy/docker/Dockerfile) on top of `nousresearch/hermes-agent`. It lays down the Planning Agent workspace at `/opt/defaults` (the `default` profile) plus two profile templates: the Platform Agent at `/opt/platform-template`, scaffolded into the `platform` profile at startup by the entrypoint, and the Cluster Agent at `/opt/cluster-template`, scaffolded into per-cluster `cluster-*` profiles at runtime by `cluster_agent_profile.py`.

- **Published by**: [`.github/workflows/docker-publish-ghcr.yml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish-ghcr.yml)
- **Also to GAR**: [`docker-publish-gcp.yml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish-gcp.yml)

The Dockerfile installs system tooling the Platform Agent needs to inspect and remediate clusters:

- `google-cloud-cli` + `google-cloud-cli-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`
- `kubectl`
- `gh` (GitHub CLI), `yq`, `k9s`, `helm`
- Standard debugging tools: `curl`, `jq`, `dnsutils`, `iputils-ping`, `patch`, `git`, `wget`, `nano`, `vim`

It also builds the `k8s-event-watcher` binary from `k8s-operator/cmd/k8s-event-watcher/` in a Go builder stage and copies it into the image.

A late build step precompiles the Python tree — `/opt/hermes`, its venv, and the stdlib — to `.pyc`. The base image ships almost none, sets `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, and `/opt/hermes` is read-only to the runtime user, so without this every short-lived process recompiled its imports from source and threw the result away. Each kanban worker is exactly such a process: a fresh `hermes -p <profile> --cli chat -q`. Shipping the bytecode costs ~170MB of image and takes about 6s off a worker's startup. It has to run after everything the Dockerfile writes into `/opt/hermes` — its patches and its bundled plugins alike — because `compileall` stamps each `.pyc` with its source's mtime and size, so bytecode written before the write would simply be discarded at import.

### `credential-proxy`

The Envoy-based credential proxy sidecar runtime. Built from the `credential-proxy` target of the same [`deploy/docker/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/deploy/docker/Dockerfile), on the shared `agent-base` stage rather than on `platform`: it adds the real `gcloud`, `kubectl`, `gh` and `git` that the sandbox image deliberately lacks, the `envoy` binary and its config, and `/opt/defaults/scripts`, which is where `start-services.sh` finds `credential_proxy.py`. It carries none of what the `platform` stage adds on top — no kube-agents personas, skills, cron entries or profile templates — because nothing in the sidecar reads them.

Building it from `agent-base` is also what keeps a one-file agent change cheap. While it was `FROM platform`, editing anything under `agents/*/scripts/` invalidated the `platform` layer that copies them and every layer after it in both images, so the sidecar paid for a full rebuild of a chain whose output it did not use.

### `replay-proxy`

The inference replay proxy used for record/replay of model traffic. Built from [`examples/inference-replay/replay-proxy/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/examples/inference-replay/replay-proxy/Dockerfile).

- **Published by**: [`docker-publish-ghcr.yml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish-ghcr.yml) and [`docker-publish-gcp.yml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish-gcp.yml)

### `k8s-operator`

The Kubebuilder-generated operator manager image.

- **Published by**: [`.github/workflows/docker-publish-k8s-operator.yml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish-k8s-operator.yml)
- **Build**: `k8s-operator/Dockerfile` (`make docker-build IMG=...`)

## Container entrypoint

`platform-agent` — and `credential-proxy`, which inherits it from the shared `agent-base` stage — run [`deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh) as their `ENTRYPOINT`, with `CMD ["hermes", "gateway", "run"]`. The sidecar never reaches it in a `PlatformAgent` Pod: the operator sets the container's `command` to `/usr/local/bin/start-services`, which replaces the image's `ENTRYPOINT` outright. Before it `exec`s whatever command it was handed, the entrypoint seeds `$HERMES_HOME` from `/opt/defaults`, scaffolds the `platform` profile, links profile-targeted plugin volumes, merges the operator-rendered config overlays, and starts the Session KV server.

Every one of those writes to the data volume, and a Pod runs this image in more than one container against a single copy of it. Exactly one container may do the setup. A second pass from a container that lacks the plugin volumes and the overlay ConfigMap does not merely duplicate the work — it reads the first container's fresh plugin links as dangling and unlinks them, and reverts the overlay whose source it cannot see. `AGENT_SHARED_STATE_SETUP` decides which container that is:

| Value                 | Effect                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner` (or `always`) | Run the setup, then `exec` the command.                                                               |
| `skip` (or `never`)   | Skip the setup and `exec` the command directly.                                                       |
| `auto`, or unset      | Infer from the command line: a bare `gateway` argument owns the shared state, anything else does not. |

An unrecognised value falls back to `auto` and logs a warning rather than guessing, because `Owner`, `true`, and `1` are otherwise indistinguishable from having set nothing at all.

The operator sets the variable explicitly on every container it builds — `owner` on the gateway, `skip` on the dashboard — so `auto` never runs under a `PlatformAgent`. Auto-detection exists for deployments with no operator to ask: Compose, plain manifests, `docker run`. Set it by hand in those if the owning container's own argv does not contain `gateway`. Above one replica the operator's gateway is itself such a case: it runs `leader_elect.py`, which starts `hermes gateway run` as a child process, so the word never appears in the container's own arguments.

Every case in that table is verified against the built image on each pull request, by the `entrypoint-gate-test` Dockerfile stage (`deploy/shared/entrypoint_gate_check.sh`). It runs the real entrypoint once per case against a scratch `$PLATFORM_AGENT_HOME` and checks the decision the gate announces against what it then writes to disk. That pairing is the point: the host-side unit tests in `tests/test_docker_entrypoint.py` cover the same table, but on a host every step below the gate is guarded on `/opt/defaults` or `/opt/hermes` and does nothing, so they can only prove which branch was taken. The script is not shipped in the runtime image, but it is safe to pipe into a running pod when diagnosing one:

```bash
kubectl exec -i deploy/platform-agent-gateway -c platform-agent -- \
  sh -s < deploy/shared/entrypoint_gate_check.sh
```

Confining it takes more than a scratch `$PLATFORM_AGENT_HOME`, because two of the setup's effects are not derived from it. Step 4 points `$HOME/.hermes/plugins/hermes_otel/config.yaml` at the config it generates — `hermes-otel` resolves its config below `~/.hermes` whatever `HERMES_HOME` says — and `$HOME` in the gateway is `/opt/data/home`, on the data PVC. Step 5 starts the Session KV server on port 8699, which is pod-wide and scoped by nothing. So each case also gets a scratch `$HOME`, and the server it spawns is killed by its scratch path as the case returns. The run ends by asserting both: that the pod's real compat symlink is byte-for-byte what it was, and that no process from the run is still alive.

CI then runs the same script a second time, as a container under `docker run --read-only --tmpfs /tmp`. The build stage above cannot cover that: a build layer is writable by definition, so it proves the entrypoint works and not that it works without writing to the root filesystem. The operator sets `readOnlyRootFilesystem` on every container it builds, which turns any such write into `EROFS`, and the entrypoint's first step runs a script this repository does not own — so the second run is what keeps an upstream change to `stage2-hook.sh` from reaching a cluster as a pod that will not start.

One thing the entrypoint does can stop the container rather than warn. Before the setup copies anything to the data volume — in the container that owns the shared state, since a `skip` container has already `exec`ed the command by this point — it checks each skill tree baked into the image (`/opt/hermes/skills`, `/opt/platform-template/skills`, `/opt/cluster-template/skills`) against the SHA-256 manifest the build wrote into it, and exits non-zero if a tree no longer matches — naming the offending file on stderr, with both digests when its content is what changed. Almost every other step here degrades with a `WARN` — the exception is step 1, which runs upstream's `stage2-hook.sh` and inherits `set -e` from the script. This one is a deliberate exception, for the reason [Security &amp; IAM](/kube-agents/reference/security-and-iam/#change-control--safety) gives. A pod crash-looping with `does not match the manifest baked beside it at build time` is reporting a corrupted or altered image, not a misconfiguration: reinstate the image the manifest belongs to rather than looking for a setting to change.

The manifest, not the checker, is what makes the check mandatory: a tree carrying one is verified or the container refuses to start. Both sides of that pairing are root-owned in the image — the manifest inside the tree it describes, the verifier in `/opt/defaults/scripts` — so `carries a build-time manifest but nothing here can check it` is not something the agent's own uid can arrange, and it is read the same way as a mismatch: an altered or truncated image, not a setting. A tree with no manifest inside it is skipped, which is how the same entrypoint stays a no-op in images that never reached the stage where manifests are written.

## Base image pin

The Hermes base image tag is pinned in [`tags.env`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/tags.env) at the repo root:

```bash
HERMES_AGENT_TAG=v2026.8.13@sha256:68e15ae2a6d894d0ccbd9f8aacbbe13d4d28fa5dc9b6a303970b67bb2499b1a6
```

Docker builds source `tags.env` via the `HERMES_AGENT_TAG` build arg:

```dockerfile
ARG HERMES_AGENT_TAG
ARG HERMES_AGENT_IMAGE=nousresearch/hermes-agent
FROM ${HERMES_AGENT_IMAGE}:${HERMES_AGENT_TAG} AS agent-base
```

Bumping Hermes = updating `tags.env` (a single-line change) and rebuilding.

## Private / custom registry

Clusters that may only pull from an approved registry need two things: a copy of every image
above in that registry, and each install layer pointed at the copy.

### 1. Mirror the images

```bash
make mirror-images MIRROR_PREFIX=registry.example.com/kube-agents
```

The target reads `images.json`, so an image added there is copied without editing the script. It
prefers `crane` (which copies a multi-arch manifest list byte-for-byte), falls back to `skopeo`,
then `docker`, and exits non-zero listing anything that failed — an incomplete mirror must not
look like success. `./scripts/mirror_images.sh --help` documents the knobs; the ones that matter
most:

- `MIRROR_THIRD_PARTY_PREFIX` — a separate destination for images this project does not build.
  Defaults to `MIRROR_PREFIX`.
- `IMAGE_TAG` — which release tag of the first-party images to copy. Defaults to `latest`.
- `INCLUDE` — which origins to copy. Defaults to `first-party,third-party`, what a running
  install pulls; add `build-time` only if you also rebuild from source.
- `--dry-run` — print the copy plan and copy nothing.

Destinations are flat, named after the inventory entry's `name`, so
`quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-webhook:v1.21.1` lands as
`<prefix>/cert-manager-webhook:v1.21.1`. The `name`, not the repository's trailing segment —
they are the same word for almost every entry, but where they differ the name wins, and
`docker.io/ankane/pgvector` lands as `<prefix>/hindsight-postgresql`. Every consumer below
assumes that flat layout.

### 2. Point the install at it

Pick the row for how you install. Each has two prefixes: one for the images this project builds,
one for the images it does not.

| Install path                      | First-party            | Third party                      | If the second is unset              | Reaches cert-manager |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `install.sh`                      | `--registry-prefix`    | `--third-party-registry-prefix`  | falls back to the first-party value | **yes**              |
| Helm chart                        | `global.imageRegistry` | `global.thirdPartyImageRegistry` | falls back to the first-party value | n/a                  |
| Terraform `examples/full-install` | `image_registry`       | `third_party_image_registry`     | falls back to the first-party value | **yes**              |

The rows are one path in three coats: `install.sh` generates the Terraform composition's
`terraform.tfvars` from its flags, and the composition passes both values to the chart's
`global.*` keys, so "third party" covers the same set everywhere — LiteLLM, fluent-bit, the
GitHub token minter, and Hindsight. cert-manager is the chart row's exception: the chart never
renders it — it expects one to be present already. The composition installs it as a separate
`helm_release` of the upstream chart and passes the third-party prefix to that release's image
repositories, so a mirrored install pulls every image — cert-manager's five included — from the
mirror. On a cluster whose cert-manager comes from somewhere else, set
`enable_cert_manager = false` and install it yourself; `images.json` carries all five of its
images, so `make mirror-images` has already copied them.
The composition's
[README](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/terraform/examples/full-install/README.md)
has the detail.

`REGISTRY_PREFIX` and `THIRD_PARTY_REGISTRY_PREFIX` are persisted to the installer's state file
(`vars.sh`) like every other knob, so re-runs reuse them; `terraform.tfvars` is regenerated from
that state on every run. Changing the registry _after_ a first run means re-running `install.sh`
with the new flag (or editing the saved values in `vars.sh` — saved state wins over a new
export).

`IMAGE_TAG` is per-run and is deliberately not saved to `vars.sh`: the installer passes it into
`terraform.tfvars` as `image_tag`, which overrides both first-party image tags in the chart. The
third-party images are excluded, because their tags come from `images.json` and have nothing to
do with `IMAGE_TAG`.

### What the prefix does not cover

Two images are resolved by the operator at reconcile time rather than rendered by any install
manifest, so they need the operator's own environment set — which the chart does automatically
when a prefix is in effect:

- `PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE` — the agent image for a `PlatformAgent` that omits
  `spec.deployment.image`.
- `FLUENT_BIT_IMAGE` — the logging sidecar injected into every agent pod.

`CREDENTIAL_PROXY_IMAGE` needs nothing: the operator derives that sidecar from the agent image by
swapping the trailing name (`platform-agent` to `credential-proxy`), which lands on the mirror on
its own. Setting it explicitly still wins, which is why `install.sh` leaves it unset — one
explicit value pins the sidecar for every agent in the cluster, and the per-CR derivation is what
otherwise keeps each sidecar in step with its own agent's image.

Per-agent, `spec.deployment.image` / `spec.deployment.tag` on a `PlatformAgent` override all of
the above for that agent's containers — see the
[PlatformAgent CRD reference](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/). The fluent-bit sidecar
has no CR-level equivalent; `FLUENT_BIT_IMAGE` is its only override.

### Rebuilding rather than copying

Every base image is a build arg, so the images can be rebuilt where the public registries are
unreachable. Each takes a full reference rather than a shared prefix, because the flat mirror
layout does not preserve the original paths:

```bash
make docker-build-platform \
  HERMES_AGENT_IMAGE=registry.example.com/mirror/hermes-agent \
  GOLANG_IMAGE=registry.example.com/mirror/golang \
  ENVOY_IMAGE=registry.example.com/mirror/envoy
```

Unset args keep their upstream defaults, so an ordinary build is unchanged. Mirror the base
images first with `INCLUDE=build-time`, and use `crane` or `skopeo` rather than `docker` — the
Hermes pin is by digest, and a `docker pull`/`push` round trip changes it.

### Registry authentication

A mirror the nodes can already read — an Artifact Registry in the same project, or a pull-through
cache — needs nothing here. One that has to be authenticated to, Harbor or Artifactory with token
auth, needs `imagePullSecrets`, set in whichever of these matches how the install was made:

- `global.imagePullSecrets` in the Helm chart, a list of Secret names — or of `{name: <secret>}`
  maps, the shape a `PodSpec` takes; any other shape fails the render. It reaches every pod the
  chart renders — the operator, the LiteLLM gateway, the `pre-delete` cleanup Job — and, through
  `IMAGE_PULL_SECRETS` on the controller manager and `spec.deployment.imagePullSecrets` on the
  `PlatformAgent` it creates, the agent pods the operator renders as well.
- `image_pull_secrets` in `terraform/examples/full-install`, which passes the same list to the
  chart.
- `spec.deployment.imagePullSecrets` on a `PlatformAgent` written by hand, or
  `IMAGE_PULL_SECRETS` (comma-separated Secret names) on the controller manager as the fleet-wide
  default for agents that do not set it. The CR **replaces** that default rather than adding to
  it, on the same terms as `spec.deployment.image` against `PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE`.

The list is pod-scoped, so it covers every image in an agent pod: the agent, the credential-proxy
and fluent-bit sidecars, anything in `initContainers`/`sidecars`, and the OCI image volumes
`AgentPlugin`s mount. Kubernetes has no per-container split.

The Secrets are referenced, never created. Registry credentials would otherwise live in Helm
release data and Terraform state, so each Secret has to exist in the agent's namespace before the
pod is scheduled:

```bash
kubectl create namespace kubeagents-system
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
  --namespace kubeagents-system \
  --docker-server=harbor.example.com \
  --docker-username=robot\$kube-agents \
  --docker-password="$TOKEN"
```

Two things this does not cover. The provisioning scripts have no flag for it, so `install.sh`
sets no pull identity for the operator, LiteLLM, and token-minter pods it applies — those need a
mirror the nodes can read, or a hand-patched Deployment. Agent pods are reachable on that path:
set `IMAGE_PULL_SECRETS` on the controller manager yourself, the same way `INSTALL.md` documents
setting `PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE`. And cert-manager is a separate Helm release of an upstream chart,
unaffected by any of the above — on a cluster whose registry needs authenticating to, install it
yourself from the mirror and set `enable_cert_manager = false`.

## Local builds

For development iteration, `make dev-rebuild-agent` (from `k8s-operator/`) is the fast path — it builds and pushes to a dev Artifact Registry repo and restarts the Deployment. See [Development](/kube-agents/operator/development/#fast-agent-iteration-dev-only).

## CI

Docker builds are validated on every PR via [`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-build.yml) — the image builds but doesn't publish. Publication happens on push to `main` (tagged with commit SHA and `:latest`). Production SemVer tags (`X.Y.Z`) are promoted from validated commit images via the release publishing workflow ([`.github/workflows/release-publish.yml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-publish.yml)) without rebuilding.
