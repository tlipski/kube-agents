  order: 1

The `PlatformAgent` resource declares everything the operator needs to run one Platform Agent instance: which Hermes image, which service account, which chat integrations, and which framework-level toggles.

- **API group / version**: `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1`
- **Kind**: `PlatformAgent`
- **Source**: [`k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/platformagent_types.go`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/platformagent_types.go)
- **Sample**: [`k8s-operator/examples/platformagent.yaml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/examples/platformagent.yaml)

## Top-level shape

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeagents.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformAgent
metadata:
  name: platformagent
  namespace: kubeagents-system
spec:
  harness: { ... } # execution environment + framework
  deployment: { ... } # container image, pull policy, containers, volumes
  security: { ... } # service account + Workload Identity
  integration: { ... } # Google Chat, Slack, GitHub
```

`spec.deployment` and `spec.security` are inlined from the shared `AgentSpec`, so they are common to every agent type. `spec.harness` is required; `spec.integration` is optional.

## `spec.harness`

Framework-level settings passed to Hermes. `clusterName`, `location`, and `projectId` are all
required — the API server rejects a `PlatformAgent` that omits any of them. The credential proxy
only renders its kubeconfig bootstrap (the `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` that gives
the agent a usable kubectl context) when it has the complete triple; with one missing, every
`kubectl` the agent runs resolves to `localhost:8080` instead of a cluster.

| `location`                               | string | Cloud region (e.g. `us-central1-a`).                                                 |
| `projectId`                              | string | GCP Project ID of the cluster. Required.                                             |
| `hermes.dashboardEnabled`                | bool   | Toggle the Hermes dashboard endpoint. Default `true`.                                |
| `hermes.pluginsDebug`                    | bool   | Enable plugin-level debug logging. Default `false`.                                  |
| `hermes.agentHome`                       | string | Path to the `AGENT_HOME` directory. Default `/opt/data`.                             |
| `hermes.apiServerSecretRef.name` + `key` | string | `Secret` holding the Hermes API server key (`API_SERVER_KEY`).                       |

| `memory.userProfileEnabled`              | bool   | Toggle per-user memory profiling. Default `false`.                                   |
| `tuning.<persona>.apiMaxRetries`         | int    | Model-call retries before a run gives up. Unset = Hermes default `3`.                |
| `tuning.<persona>.maxTurns`              | int    | Iterations allowed in a single turn. Unset = Hermes default `90`.                    |
| `tuning.maxInProgress`                   | int    | Board-wide cap on concurrent kanban workers. Unset = uncapped (upstream).            |

### `spec.harness.tuning`

Execution limits per agent persona, where `<persona>` is one of `default` (the Chat Agent front
door), `platform` (the Platform Agent), or `cluster` (**every** Cluster Agent), plus the board-wide
`maxInProgress`.

**Everything here is opt-in.** Unset means Hermes' own defaults apply — 3 retries, 90 iterations,
uncapped dispatch. The operator pins nothing of its own, and the agent image ships no overrides:
what a fleet needs depends on its model quota and on what its agents actually do, so a deployment
doing short interactive work should not inherit limits raised for long-running batch work.

```yaml
spec:
  harness:
    tuning:
      maxInProgress: 1 # board-wide: serialise all kanban workers
      platform:
        apiMaxRetries: 8
        maxTurns: 200
      cluster:
        apiMaxRetries: 8
        maxTurns: 150
```

Raised limits belong with the workload that needs them, not with the platform. A long-running,
quota-hungry agent plugin should ship its own tuning — as a patch its installer applies — so that a
deployment without it stays on Hermes defaults, and installing the plugin brings the limits it
requires along with it.

The GKE Stockout Investigator is the worked example:
[`agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/tuning.yaml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/tuning.yaml)
records the reasoning behind each number, and its `install.sh` applies it.

The keys are personas rather than profile names because the profiles are not all known when the CR
is written: Cluster Agent profiles are scaffolded at runtime, one per managed cluster, with
generated names like `cluster-<project>-<cluster>-<region>`. `cluster` therefore applies to all of
them at once — including ones onboarded after the pod last started, which pick the limits up as they
are scaffolded.

Both limits matter because they fail the same way, and it is not an obvious way. A run that
exhausts either stops mid-task without calling a terminal kanban tool, so the dispatcher records a
**protocol violation** — a message that describes the symptom and hides the cause. Retrying then
re-runs into the same wall. If you see repeated protocol violations, check these limits and the
upstream error rate before suspecting the worker.

Sizing notes: `maxTurns` is consumed mostly by repository exploration, so scale it against how much
the agent has to read rather than how complex the request is. `apiMaxRetries` exists because
Hermes' default of `3` assumes an interactive session where a human retries; a background worker
has nobody to retry it, so a transient burst of upstream 429s or 503s simply ends the run. Raising
`maxTurns` interacts with `maxInProgress`: under a serial dispatcher, one long-running worker
holds the only slot and blocks every other profile, so raising one is a reason to reconsider the
other.

## `spec.deployment`

Abstracts the pod/deployment configuration. The controller synthesises a `Deployment` from these plus the workspace ConfigMaps. Available fields:

- `image` — container image repository.
- `tag` — image tag. Applies only when `image` is set without a tag or digest, falling back to `latest` there; when `image` is omitted, the operator's build-injected default version applies instead.
- `imagePullPolicy` — one of `Always`, `Never`, `IfNotPresent`. Default `IfNotPresent`.
- `browserArgs` — extra command-line args for the agent's browser (e.g. `--no-sandbox`).
- `runtimeClassName` — pod runtime class (e.g. `gvisor`).
- `env` — additional container environment variables.
- `initContainers` / `sidecars` — standard init and sidecar containers.
- `extraVolumes` / `extraVolumeMounts` — custom volumes and mounts for the main container.
- `sidecarVolumes` — custom volumes for the sidecar containers.
- `podAnnotations` — annotations applied to the generated pod template.
- `scaleToZero` — when `true`, scales the deployment to 0 replicas (idle cost saving).

Default image: `ghcr.io/gke-labs/kube-agents/platform-agent:<operator release version>` (release builds inject the version; development builds fall back to `latest`), overridable operator-wide via the `PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE` env var on the controller manager (see [Docker images § Private / custom registry](/kube-agents/deploy/docker-images/#private--custom-registry)). Rebuild with `make dev-rebuild-agent ARGS="platform"` for local iteration.

## `spec.security`

- `serviceAccountName` — the KSA the pod runs as. `kubeagents-platform-agent` by convention.
- `serviceAccountAnnotations` — passed through to the KSA. Typically holds `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account` for Workload Identity binding.

The Workload Identity target GSA (`kubeagents-platform-gsa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) is created and bound by `provision_04_gcp_iam.sh` with one of these permission sets:

- `read-only` (default)
- `gke-admin`
- `custom` (roles supplied via `PLATFORM_AGENT_CUSTOM_ROLES`)

## `spec.integration`

Enables external integrations. Only the enabled ones need to be present.

- **`googleChat`** — `enabled` (default `false`), `projectId`, `topicName`, `subscriptionName`, `allowedUsers`, `homeChannel`, and `mode` (`default` or `debug`, default `default`). When `enabled`, `projectId`, `topicName`, and `subscriptionName` are required (enforced by a CEL validation rule). Populated by `provision_05_gcp_gchat.sh`.
- **`slack`** — `enabled` (default `false`), `botTokenSecretRef` and `appTokenSecretRef` (Secret refs, required when enabled), `allowedUsers`, `homeChannel`, and `homeChannelName`. Populated by `provision_06_slack.sh` when `SLACK_ENABLED=true`.
- **`github`** — `gitRepo`, the target GitOps repository URL for the agent environment (up to 2048 characters). Supports HTTPS/HTTP (`https://`, `http://`), SCP-style SSH (`git@...`), SSH/Git protocols (`ssh://`, `git://`), and bare `owner/repo` shorthand (e.g. `gke-labs/kube-agents`). Rejects URLs containing whitespace, control characters, or invalid syntax at admission (`failurePolicy: Fail`). If an invalid URL is encountered during reconciliation, `SETTINGS.md` defaults to `None` and a `Degraded` condition (`Reason: InvalidGitRepoURL`) is surfaced on the resource status. Populated by `provision_10_deploy_github_minter.sh`.

See [`k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/platformagent_types.go`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/platformagent_types.go) for the exact struct definitions.

## `status`

The operator writes observed state to the `status` subresource:

| Field                            | Type   | Purpose                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `phase`                          | string | Overall state (`Pending`, `Provisioning`, `Ready`, `Failed`). |
| `address`                        | string | Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the agent service.      |
| `lastReconcileTime`              | time   | Timestamp of the last status update.                          |
| `conditions`                     | list   | Standard `metav1.Condition` observations, keyed by `type`.    |
| `deploymentStatus.name`          | string | Name of the underlying Deployment.                            |
| `deploymentStatus.readyReplicas` | int32  | Number of fully ready replicas.                               |
| `serviceStatus.endpoint`         | string | Primary URL/IP (with protocol and port) to reach the agent.   |
| `storageStatus.bound`            | bool   | Whether the primary PVC has been provisioned.                 |

## How config reaches each profile

A deployment runs several Hermes **profiles** from one pod: `default` (the Chat Agent front door),
`platform`, and one `cluster-*` profile per managed cluster. The operator delivers configuration to
them in two different ways, and the asymmetry is deliberate.

| Profile     | Delivery                                                                                                 | Who owns the file                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `default`   | Whole `config.yaml`, rendered by the operator and mounted over it                                        | Operator, authoritative                   |
| `platform`  | Image-built base + `profile-platform.overlay.yaml` merged at startup                                     | Image owns the base, operator the overlay |
| `cluster-*` | Image-built base + `profileclass-cluster.overlay.yaml`, plus `profile-<name>.overlay.yaml` if one exists | Image owns the base, operator the overlay |

A cluster profile is the only one that can take two overlays: the class overlay carries
`tuning.cluster`, which applies to all of them, and a plugin targeting one specific cluster produces
a `profile-<name>` overlay for it as well. The class overlay merges first, so the per-profile file
wins any conflict.

**Why `default` is rendered whole.** It is the only profile whose config the operator can fully
own, and the only one that is a change-control boundary: the mount guarantees the deployed front
door matches CR-derived intent and cannot drift from a stale copy on the PVC or an image/operator
version skew. (It is _not_ a security sandbox — see the
[AgentPlugin trust boundary](/kube-agents/reference/security-and-iam/#change-control--safety).)

**Why the others get overlays.** Their `config.yaml` is assembled at image build time by merging the
shared defaults with that profile's own overlay, content the operator does not have; a `cluster-*`
config additionally carries a runtime `cluster_identity` stamp that the reconciler matches profiles
to clusters by. Rendering either file in full would fork the source of truth and, for cluster
profiles, strip that identity record.

Overlays are ConfigMap keys in the same ConfigMap as `config.yaml`, so a change to either moves the
config hash and rolls the pod. That restart is required, not incidental: the merge happens once at
startup, so a live ConfigMap update without a restart would be a no-op.

Startup is not the only moment a merge happens. Onboarding a cluster scaffolds a new profile without
changing the ConfigMap, so nothing rolls the pod; that profile applies the overlays itself as it is
created. Without it a Cluster Agent created between two pod starts would run on Hermes' own defaults
however the CR is tuned.

**Ordering.** The entrypoint force-syncs each profile's image-owned files first, then merges the
overlays. The reverse order would silently erase every overlay on each restart.

**Merge semantics.** Maps merge recursively, lists union (so `plugins.enabled` accumulates), and
scalars are replaced by the overlay. Precedence, lowest to highest: Hermes built-in default → the
value committed in `agents/<persona>/config.yaml` → the operator overlay from the CR.

**Two writers, two authorities.** Both `spec.harness.tuning` (operator policy) and an
`AgentPlugin`'s `spec.config` (plugin-supplied) land in the same overlay file, but not with equal
rights. A plugin's config is restricted to `approvals`, `platforms`, and `platform_toolsets`; the
`agent` subtree holding the execution limits is dropped from plugin config and writable only by the
operator. That is a coordination boundary rather than a security one — plugin code executes
in-process and could change these at runtime — but it keeps limits with board-wide consequences in
one reviewable place.

## Reconcile behavior

- On create/update, the controller ensures the Deployment, Service, ServiceAccount, and ConfigMaps match the spec.
- On delete, it garbage-collects owned resources.
- The admission webhook (behind cert-manager) validates the spec before it's persisted; it enforces at most one `PlatformAgent` per project, forbids sensitive environment variable overrides (`API_SERVER_KEY`, `HERMES_HOME`) and privileged containers/volumes (`hostPath`), and acts as a name-based tripwire against obvious privileged service account names (`cluster-admin`, `system:admin`). Note that full RBAC least-privilege enforcement is handled by controller- and pipeline-level policies rather than the admission webhook.
- The `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/prevent-deletion: "true"` annotation on a `PlatformAgent` blocks deletion of the resource via the validating webhook (`ValidateDelete`). This serves as an accidental-deletion guardrail rather than an authorization control — `ValidateUpdate` does not block removing the annotation, so any principal with update permissions can patch the annotation off before deleting.
- `provision_08_deploy_platform_agent.sh` renders and applies the CR; you can also edit it directly with `kubectl edit`.

## Where to go next

- [Development](/kube-agents/operator/development/) — build and test the controller locally.
- [Provisioning scripts](/kube-agents/operator/provisioning-scripts/) — how the CR gets applied in a fresh install.
