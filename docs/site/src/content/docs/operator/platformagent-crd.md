title: PlatformAgent CRD
description: The single custom resource the operator reconciles.
sidebar:
  order: 1
---

The `PlatformAgent` resource declares everything the operator needs to run one Platform Agent instance: which Hermes image, which service account, which chat integrations, and which framework-level toggles.

- **API group / version**: `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1`
- **Kind**: `PlatformAgent`
- **Source**: [`k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/platformagent_types.go`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/platformagent_types.go)
- **Sample**: [`k8s-operator/examples/platformagent.yaml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/examples/platformagent.yaml)

## Top-level shape

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeagents.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: PlatformAgent
metadata:
  name: platformagent
  namespace: kubeagents-system
spec:
  harness: { ... } # execution environment + framework
  deployment: { ... } # container image, pull policy, containers, volumes
  security: { ... } # service account + Workload Identity
  telemetry: { ... } # OTLP collector endpoint (optional)
  networkPolicy: { ... } # generated egress NetworkPolicy (optional)
  integration: { ... } # Google Chat, Slack, GitHub
```

`spec.deployment`, `spec.security`, `spec.telemetry`, and `spec.networkPolicy` are inlined from the shared `AgentSpec`, so they are common to every agent type. `spec.harness` is required; `spec.integration`, `spec.telemetry`, and `spec.networkPolicy` are optional.

## `spec.harness`

Framework-level settings passed to Hermes. `clusterName`, `location`, and `projectId` are all
required — the API server rejects a `PlatformAgent` that omits any of them. The credential proxy
only renders its kubeconfig bootstrap (the `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` that gives
the agent a usable kubectl context) when it has the complete triple; with one missing, every
`kubectl` the agent runs resolves to `localhost:8080` instead of a cluster.

`dashboardEnabled` publishes port `9119` on the agent Service, but nothing answers there: `hermes
dashboard` binds `127.0.0.1`, so a request arriving over the pod network gets connection refused.
Reaching it means getting inside the pod's network namespace — `kubectl port-forward svc/<agent>
9119:9119` on an ordinary node pool, and
[`scripts/hermes-dashboard-tunnel.py`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/scripts/hermes-dashboard-tunnel.py)
on a GKE Sandbox (gVisor) one, where port-forward is set up in the host-side netns and cannot see
the sandbox's listener. That script is canonical on the dashboard's access path and on why the
loopback bind is deliberate; the exec relay it uses to get inside the sandbox lives in
[`scripts/exec_tunnel.py`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/scripts/exec_tunnel.py),
shared with the E2E suite, which reaches the agent API the same way and for the same reason. The container's readiness probe runs `curl` against loopback for the same reason a
`tcpSocket` probe cannot work here: kubelet dials the pod IP, and nothing is listening on it.

`sessionKVApiKeySecretRef` is optional in the API but not in practice, and the `503` above is the
milder half of what its absence costs. The `k8s-event-watcher` in the credential sidecar
authenticates to that same server, treats an empty `SESSION_KV_API_KEY` as fatal, and exits on every
start — so no cluster events are watched at all, while the container stays Ready and the CR
`.status` says nothing. An installation upgraded from before the key existed is the case that lands
here; add the key to the agent Secret and restart the pod.

### `spec.harness.memory`

`provider` picks which long-term memory implementation the agents load. Two ship in this repository,
and the difference between them is the whole choice:

| Value                          | Fits                       | What it costs to run                                      | What it gives                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `multiuser_memory` _(default)_ | small or personal installs | nothing — a per-user Markdown file inside the pod         | verbatim recall of everything, no ranking or search      |
| `kube_agents_memory`           | enterprise deployments     | a Hindsight API server and a Postgres database in-cluster | ranked recall, per-user and shared scopes, consolidation |
| `none`                         | —                          | nothing                                                   | no provider; Hermes' built-in store only                 |

The split is about how the store is read, not about how good it is. The file provider concatenates
everything into the system prompt on every turn, so it is bounded by the context window; Hindsight
retrieves only what a question needs, so its cost per turn barely moves as the store grows. A fleet
of a few clusters and a handful of people will not reach the bound, and paying for a database there
buys nothing.

Anything else is passed through to Hermes untouched, so its own external providers (`hindsight`,
`mem0`, `openviking`, …) work if you bring their configuration. `none` is this API's spelling of
Hermes' empty string, which cannot be expressed here: an absent field takes the CRD default.

Only a Hindsight-backed provider reaches the specialist profiles, because only that one can be made
read-only and scoped by tag. Under any other value the specialists get no provider at all and the
Planning Agent keeps the store to itself.

`memoryEnabled` and `userProfileEnabled` are a **different** mechanism — Hermes' built-in
`MEMORY.md` / `USER.md` files, which have no per-user scoping. Both providers above replace that
store rather than supplement it, so both run with `memoryEnabled: false`.

The installer's `MEMORY_ENABLED` variable is that same built-in store and nothing more; the install
copies it into this field unchanged. It is not a master switch — whether the agent remembers
anything is `provider`'s question, and `none` is how that answers no.

The install reads only the provider: the chart's `hindsight.*` values deploy the Hindsight store
when the provider is Hindsight-backed (`--memory=hindsight`), and nothing when it is
`multiuser_memory` or `none`. See
[`docs/designs/memory.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/docs/designs/memory.md).

### `spec.harness.eventWatcher`

The `k8s-event-watcher` runs in the credential sidecar, streams warning events from every managed
cluster, and posts each surviving incident to the pod-local Session KV server, which opens an
autonomous triage session for it. `enabled: false` stops it from starting at all.

```bash
kubectl patch platformagent platform-agent -n kubeagents-system --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"harness":{"eventWatcher":{"enabled":false}}}}'
```

The field has to exist in the installed CRD for that patch to mean anything, and
[Helm installs CRDs on first install but never upgrades them](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/charts/kube-agents/README.md).
A chart-upgraded install therefore needs the CRDs applied first — worth doing ahead of the incident
rather than during it, since a client that does not send strict field validation gets the unknown
field pruned and an emergency stop that reports success and does nothing.

```bash
kubectl apply --server-side -f k8s-operator/config/crd/bases/
```

`--server-side` is not optional here. Client-side apply stores the whole object in the
`kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation, and this CRD is far past the 262144-byte
annotation cap, so a plain `kubectl apply` fails with `metadata.annotations: Too long` and leaves the
CRD unchanged. `make install` in `k8s-operator/` applies them the same way.

**This is an emergency stop, not a tuning knob.** It exists for the case where events arrive faster
than the agent can triage them — a fleet-wide rollout gone wrong, a node pool flapping — and the
cheapest way to get the agent back is to cut the inflow rather than chase the cards it has already
been handed. It is all-or-nothing across every watched cluster: the watcher's reason and namespace
filters live in the sidecar's entrypoint and are not exposed on the CRD, so there is no way to
silence one noisy namespace through this field. If the board is merely busy rather than swamped,
[`tuning.maxInProgress`](#specharnesstuning) is the knob for that — it throttles how many cards run at
once without losing the events.

Three consequences before you press it:

- **It rolls the pod.** The value reaches the sidecar as an environment variable, so changing it
  rewrites the pod template. During a storm that restart is usually wanted anyway — it is also what
  ends the sessions already running.
- **It stops the inflow only.** Kanban cards and sessions created from events already delivered keep
  running and still have to be dealt with on the board. It reclaims nothing either: the watcher's
  kubeconfig, token projection, and mounts stay in place, and the sidecar keeps the memory request
  sized for the informer and dedup caches it is no longer running.
- **Nothing turns it back on.** An install left with the watcher off has no incident detection at
  all, and the container stays Ready throughout — the readiness probe covers the credential proxy,
  not the watcher. Two things say otherwise: a line in the sidecar log naming the consequence, and
  the `EventWatcher` condition on the CR ([`status`](#status) below). Set `enabled: true`, or remove
  the field, to start watching again.

Unset means enabled. The watcher is how a fleet notices its own incidents, so an install that never
mentions the field — which is every install today — keeps watching, and only an explicit `false`
turns it off.

### `spec.harness.tuning`

Execution limits per agent persona, where `<persona>` is one of `default` (the Planning Agent front
door), `platform` (the Platform Agent), or `cluster` (**every** Cluster Agent), plus the board-wide
`maxInProgress`.

**The per-run limits are opt-in.** The operator pins nothing of its own there: what a fleet needs
depends on its model quota and on what its agents actually do, so a deployment doing short
interactive work should not inherit limits raised for long-running batch work. Unset therefore means
whatever the profile's own `config.yaml` carries, and the `default` and `cluster` configs set no
execution limit of their own — Hermes' defaults apply there, 3 retries and 90 iterations. The
`platform` profile is the exception: the image ships `agent.max_turns: 250` in
`agents/platform/config.yaml` because the fleet audits outgrow 90, and
[Config reference](/kube-agents/reference/config/#agent) is canonical for why. Setting
`tuning.platform.maxTurns` here still wins — the overlay is merged after the image force-sync — and
removing it restores the image's value rather than Hermes'.

**`maxInProgress` is not.** Unset renders `2`, because the untuned case is the one that cannot
absorb the alternative — see [Why dispatch is capped by default](#why-dispatch-is-capped-by-default)
below. Set it on the CR to raise or lower that.

```yaml
spec:
  harness:
    tuning:
      maxInProgress: 4 # board-wide; raises the operator's default of 2
      platform:
        apiMaxRetries: 8
        maxTurns: 200
      cluster:
        apiMaxRetries: 8
        maxTurns: 150
```

Raised limits belong with the workload that needs them, not with the platform. A long-running,
quota-hungry agent plugin should ship its own tuning — as a patch its installer applies — so that a
deployment without it stays on Hermes defaults, and installing the plugin brings the limits it
requires along with it.

The GKE Stockout Investigator is the worked example:
[`agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/tuning.yaml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/tuning.yaml)
records the reasoning behind each number, and its `install.sh` applies it.

The keys are personas rather than profile names because the profiles are not all known when the CR
is written: Cluster Agent profiles are scaffolded at runtime, one per managed cluster, with
generated names like `cluster-<project>-<cluster>-<region>`. `cluster` therefore applies to all of
them at once — including ones onboarded after the pod last started, which pick the limits up as they
are scaffolded.

Both limits matter because they fail the same way, and it is not an obvious way. A run that
exhausts either stops mid-task without ever calling a terminal kanban tool. The card is charged a
`timed_out` failure whose error text names how the turn ended — `Iteration budget exhausted (N/M)`
for `maxTurns`, `turn_exit_reason=all_retries_exhausted_no_response` for `apiMaxRetries` — and
retrying re-runs into the same wall, so read that text and the upstream error rate before suspecting
the worker. An exit like this that reaches the dispatcher unexplained surfaces instead as a
**protocol violation**, which describes the symptom and hides the cause; the image narrows that
window in [`deploy/docker/patches/kanban_guardrail_exit.py`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/deploy/docker/patches/kanban_guardrail_exit.py).

Sizing notes: `maxTurns` is consumed mostly by repository exploration, so scale it against how much
the agent has to read rather than how complex the request is. `apiMaxRetries` exists because
Hermes' default of `3` assumes an interactive session where a human retries; a background worker
has nobody to retry it, so a transient burst of upstream 429s or 503s simply ends the run. Raising
`maxTurns` interacts with `maxInProgress`: a long-running worker holds its slot for the whole task
and there are only `maxInProgress` of them, so raising one is a reason to reconsider the other.

#### Why dispatch is capped by default

A kanban worker is not a coroutine. It is a full `hermes … kanban task` process — a few hundred MiB
resident once its MCP proxies are up, and alive for as long as the task takes, which for an incident
triage is minutes rather than seconds. Uncapped, the dispatcher starts one per queued card, and a
burst of cluster events queues them faster than they retire.

What follows is invisible in the places you would look. The cgroup OOM killer takes a worker, not
PID 1, so there is no container restart and no Kubernetes event; the pod stays `Running` and the
only trace is `pid not alive` in the kanban ledger. The dispatcher's retry budget is 1, so the card
is stranded rather than re-dispatched, and the work it stood for is never done — a triage report
that simply never arrives, with nothing anywhere reporting a failure.

`2` is a floor for a deployment that has not measured itself, not a recommendation. It is chosen to
hold on the smallest pod anyone runs, and because the cost of being wrong is asymmetric: too low
delays a delegated task, too high loses it silently. Raise it once you know your worker footprint
and your model quota — that quota is the other shared resource, and for most deployments it binds
before memory does.

### `spec.harness.experimental`

Opt-in switches with no compatibility promise. A field here may change meaning, change its default,
or be removed outright in any release; an install that depends on one is expected to re-check it at
every upgrade. Fields live here while the question they answer is still open — once it is settled
the switch either graduates into a supported block or goes away.

#### `platformFrontDoor`

Makes the **Platform Agent** the profile the Hermes gateway runs as, so a chat message is handled by
the agent that has the tools instead of arriving at the Planning Agent, which delegates through the
router MCP server and the kanban board.

```bash
kubectl patch platformagent platform-agent -n kubeagents-system --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"harness":{"experimental":{"platformFrontDoor":true}}}}'
```

Three things change while it is on:

- The gateway container runs `hermes --profile platform gateway run`. Above one replica the container
  still runs `leader_elect.py`, which reads the same choice from `HERMES_GATEWAY_PROFILE` and builds
  that command line for the process it supervises.
- `profile-platform.overlay.yaml` gains the three profile-shaped things only the `default` profile
  carried before: the toolsets each chat platform key resolves, the ingress plugins, and the
  `kanban` block. The adapters themselves are not copied — the managed scope at `/etc/hermes` is
  machine-global, so `platforms.*` and `display.platforms` already land on this profile. `kanban`
  does have to follow the gateway, because the dispatcher and the notifier run in the gateway
  process and read their settings from its own home; that is what keeps
  [`tuning.maxInProgress`](#specharnesstuning) applying. The board itself does not move — Hermes
  anchors `kanban.db` at the shared root rather than the active profile, deliberately, so the
  dispatcher/worker handoff survives — so cards in flight are unaffected by the flip.
- The entrypoint stops force-syncing `profiles/platform/config.yaml` from the image and back-fills
  it instead, on the same terms as the `default` profile's own file, so `/sethome` and
  `monitoring.install_id` survive a restart — see
  [How config reaches each profile](#how-config-reaches-each-profile).

Setting the field back to `false` reverses all three. The overlay records what it applied, so the
keys are unapplied rather than left behind, and the force-sync resumes.

**What it costs.** The Planning Agent's lockdown is its whole reason for existing: a front door
with three toolsets, so an inbound message cannot reach the full Platform Agent tool surface before a
card and a worker turn have framed it. With this on, an inbound message reaches that surface
directly. The lockdown is deliberately **not** copied onto the platform profile — copying it would
leave the Platform Agent unable to do the work the flag exists to let it do.

**Known limits.**

- One gateway means one profile, so this is not additive. While it is on, the Planning Agent persona sees
  no chat at all and the router MCP path is simply unused. Kanban delegation is not: the front door
  keeps `dispatch_in_gateway`, so it can still hand a card to a spawned worker — it just does so as
  the agent that could also have done the work itself.
- `gateway.multiplex_profiles` is still off, so a `/p/<profile>/` prefix on an API request is
  ignored. Those requests now land on the Platform Agent rather than the Planning Agent.
- The `hermes dashboard` sidecar is deliberately left on the `default` profile, so the dashboard
  shows that profile's sessions while the front door is the platform one.
- **An [`AgentPlugin`](./agentplugin-crd.md) without a `spec.targetProfile` does not follow the
  gateway.** The two halves that decide whether it loads at all stay on the `default` profile: the
  image volume is mounted at `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/<name>`, and the name is added to that profile's
  `plugins.enabled`. With the flag on, the gateway is homed at `profiles/platform` and reads
  neither, so the plugin never registers — silently, since nothing errors, and its `platforms:`
  block does arrive here through the machine-global managed scope, configuring an adapter that has
  nothing to configure. The `pubsub-platform` adapter and the `gke-stockout-investigator` alert
  route that depends on it are both affected. Setting `spec.targetProfile: platform` moves the
  plugin and its `platform_toolsets` across.
- **The `default` profile's cron roster stops ticking.** Hermes binds its cron ticker to one
  `HERMES_HOME` — the job store, the execution ledger and `.tick.lock` all resolve from the gateway
  process's own home — so the one roster that ticks becomes `profiles/platform/cron/jobs.json`. The
  Platform Agent's own watchdogs therefore tick natively, which is the upside; the cost is that the
  four jobs on the `default` roster never come due. Those are `cluster-agent-reconcile`, which
  scaffolds a profile for a newly onboarded cluster and prunes one for a deleted cluster;
  `bootstrap-inventory-scan` and `bootstrap-inventory-delivery`, which are first-run onboarding; and
  `profile-cron-tick`, the only thing that ticks a **named** profile's own store — so every
  `cluster-*` roster goes quiet with it. Nothing errors and nothing is logged: a job that is never
  ticked simply stays `scheduled` with a `next_run_at` in the past.
- **Per-user memory does not follow the gateway either.** The front door's provider is
  `multiuser_memory`, committed in `agents/chat/config.yaml` and reaching the `default` profile
  alone. The platform profile is configured as a specialist instead: `read_only: true` from the
  image, and a `memory.provider` its overlay blanks unless
  [`spec.harness.memory`](#specharnessmemory) names a Hindsight-backed store. With the flag on the
  front door is that profile, so chat has no recall, no per-user profile and no retention — while
  `memory` stays in the profile's toolsets advertising all three. The keys cannot simply be copied
  across, because `profiles/platform/config.yaml` is shared: it is also the home of every
  kanban-spawned specialist and every job on the platform cron roster. Lifting `read_only` there
  would let a specialist write the shared corpus, and un-blanking the provider would collapse those
  writes into one anonymous bucket, since a specialist carries no gateway identity to scope a
  per-user store by. Carrying memory to the front door needs those settings to be per-process
  rather than per-profile.
- **First-run onboarding does not follow the gateway.** Its two jobs are on the `default` roster the
  bullet above stops ticking, and its greeting hook — the `bootstrap_onboarding` plugin — resolves
  its once-per-deployment markers from the gateway's home, so on the platform profile it would greet
  an already-onboarded install and promise a report nothing can deliver. The operator therefore
  leaves that plugin off the front door deliberately. Bring an install up with the flag off, let
  onboarding finish, then turn it on.
- **A home channel set with `/sethome` stays on the profile it was set on.** The operator renders no
  `home_channel` of its own, so on an install that did not populate the CR's Google Chat or Slack
  `homeChannel` the value lives only in the config file the gateway last wrote. Flipping the flag
  changes which file that is, and nothing carries it across. The Platform Agent's own `deliver: all`
  watchdogs then tick in-process, where the delivery target is read from the environment alone —
  so every scheduled report posts nowhere while chat replies stay healthy and the install looks
  fine. Either populate `homeChannel` on the CR before flipping, or re-run `/sethome` after.
- **`chat_message_audit` stops recording.** It is a hook rather than a plugin, and hooks are only
  ever copied into the root home — nothing puts them on a named profile, and Hermes reads
  `$HERMES_HOME/hooks` and returns silently when the directory is absent. `tool_call_audit` is a
  plugin, is enabled on this profile and still records the inbound message with its session and
  pseudonymised user id, so what is actually lost is the record carrying the agent's **response**
  text. Response content remains in the session store.
- **The platform profile's `config.yaml` stops being restored from the image on every restart.**
  Handing the file to the agent is the point — that is what lets `/sethome` and
  `monitoring.install_id` survive — but the same change means a key the running agent writes there
  is not reverted at boot. Keys the image adds still arrive through the back-fill; keys already in
  the file stay as they were last written. Operator-owned settings are unaffected: they come from
  the overlay and the `/etc/hermes` pins, both re-applied every boot.
- Cluster profiles that already exist are otherwise unaffected — their config, skills and
  scaffolding on disk are unchanged and they keep working. What stops is the scheduled work above,
  which includes `cluster-agent-reconcile`, so a cluster onboarded while the flag is on gets no
  profile until the flag goes back off.

## `spec.deployment`

Abstracts the pod/deployment configuration. The controller synthesises a `Deployment` from these plus the workspace ConfigMaps. Available fields:

- `image` — container image repository.
- `tag` — image tag. Applies only when `image` is set without a tag or digest, falling back to `latest` there; when `image` is omitted, the operator's default platform-agent version applies instead.
- `imagePullPolicy` — one of `Always`, `Never`, `IfNotPresent`. Default `IfNotPresent`.
- `imagePullSecrets` — Secrets in the agent's namespace holding registry credentials, as
  `- name: <secret>` entries. Referenced, not created: each must exist before the pod is
  scheduled. Pod-scoped, so it covers the agent, both injected sidecars, anything in
  `initContainers`/`sidecars`, and the OCI image volumes `AgentPlugin`s mount.
- `browserArgs` — extra command-line args for the agent's browser (e.g. `--no-sandbox`).
- `runtimeClassName` — pod runtime class (e.g. `gvisor`).
- `env` — additional container environment variables.
- `initContainers` / `sidecars` — standard init and sidecar containers.
- `extraVolumes` / `extraVolumeMounts` — custom volumes and mounts for the main container.
- `sidecarVolumes` — custom volumes for the sidecar containers.
- `podAnnotations` — annotations applied to the generated pod template.
- `scaleToZero` — when `true`, scales the deployment to 0 replicas (idle cost saving).

Default image: derived dynamically from the operator's container image at runtime via the `OPERATOR_IMAGE` env var on the controller manager (e.g. `ghcr.io/gke-labs/kube-agents/platform-agent:<version>`), overridable operator-wide via the `PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE` env var on the controller manager (see [Docker images § Private / custom registry](/kube-agents/deploy/docker-images/#private--custom-registry)), and falling back to `ghcr.io/gke-labs/kube-agents/platform-agent:latest` if neither is set. Rebuild with `make dev-rebuild-agent ARGS="platform"` for local iteration.

`imagePullSecrets` has the same operator-wide form, `IMAGE_PULL_SECRETS` on the controller manager, taking comma-separated Secret names. It differs from the image overrides in one way: a CR that sets `imagePullSecrets` **replaces** the operator's list rather than merging with it, so an agent that names its own registry identity is stating it completely. See [Docker images § Registry authentication](/kube-agents/deploy/docker-images/#registry-authentication).

## `spec.security`

- `serviceAccountName` — the KSA the pod runs as. `kubeagents-platform-agent` by convention.
- `serviceAccountAnnotations` — passed through to the KSA. Typically holds `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account` for Workload Identity binding.
- `splitCredentialBrokerPod` — default `false`, and **leave it off for now**. Renders the credential broker as its own Deployment and Service instead of a sidecar. The broker still runs commands in a directory the agent created on the shared data volume, so today both Pods have to see the same files: on the default ReadWriteOnce disk the broker Pod cannot attach the volume, never becomes ready, and every proxied command reports the credential proxy as unavailable. That coupling is being removed rather than worked around — the broker will own the workspace on its own ordinary volume and take file content from the agent instead of a directory — and the flag becomes adoptable then. A ReadWriteMany claim satisfies the current design if you want it, but it is not something this product requires of you, and co-scheduling both Pods on one node is not a workaround. **Also requires `harness.eventWatcher.enabled: false`** — the event watcher lives in the credential container and delivers over the agent Pod's loopback, so the split strands it; asking for both is refused with `Degraded`/`SplitBrokerStrandsEventWatcher`. See [Credential isolation § Splitting the broker into its own Pod](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/#splitting-the-broker-into-its-own-pod).

- `egressPolicy` — `None` (default) or `Allowlist`. `Allowlist` renders a default-deny egress NetworkPolicy on the agent Pod, with the link-local metadata server left off the allowlist. **It blocks nothing today, and cannot — unless `networkPolicy.enabled: false` has withheld the gateway policy on a Helm install, in which case this becomes the Pod's only policy and default-denies for real on an enforcing CNI (a Kustomize install still carries the static `platform-agent-core-egress` set over the same Pod).** Everywhere else: adding a policy is monotone — policies selecting one Pod are unioned and the API has no deny rule — and the same Pod is already selected by `<name>-gateway-netpol`, which permits `169.254.169.254/32` on TCP 80, the discovered metadata-daemon port (`988` by default) to both link-local metadata addresses, and TCP 443 to `0.0.0.0/0` minus the private ranges. So enabling this widens the Pod's permitted egress (by the broker on 8765, and by the collector namespace on 4317/4318 when the agent is not exporting telemetry) and narrows nothing; what you get is an auditable object, not enforcement. Narrowing the gateway policy once the broker has left the Pod is what makes it a control, and the capability cost lands then. **Requires `splitCredentialBrokerPod: true`** — a NetworkPolicy selects Pods and not containers, and the broker reaches the metadata server on purpose, so the combination is refused with `Degraded`/`EgressPolicyRequiresSplitBroker` rather than rendered. It will also do nothing on a cluster whose CNI does not enforce NetworkPolicy, which the operator cannot detect. See [Credential isolation § Denying the sandbox the metadata server](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/#denying-the-sandbox-the-metadata-server).
- `egressAllowlist` — tunes `egressPolicy: Allowlist`. `controlPlaneCIDRs` permits the Kubernetes API server on 443 (absent by default, which costs the agent container its API-server connection; a bare address — what the documented `gcloud` command emits for a public endpoint — is widened to a single-host prefix); `extraRules` are NetworkPolicy egress rules appended verbatim — except that a rule the operator will not render (an `ipBlock` reaching a metadata address, including in IPv4-mapped form; a rule with no `to` peers; a peer naming no `ipBlock`, `podSelector` or `namespaceSelector`; an invalid CIDR, in `cidr` or `except`; an `except` outside its `cidr`, which the API server would reject in a way that wedges the whole reconcile; or `controlPlaneCIDRs` wider than /16 IPv4 or /32 IPv6) is refused loudly rather than silently dropped: the agent goes `Degraded`/`EgressAllowlistRefused`, the workload stops being reconciled, and the policy keeps being rendered minus the refused destinations.
- `scopedServiceAccounts` — the cluster→service-account mapping for the [scoped service account pool](/kube-agents/reference/security-and-iam/#the-scoped-service-account-pool). Absent (the default) the pool is disarmed and the broker runs on the agent's own identity. A non-empty list arms it: the operator renders the mapping into the credential-proxy ConfigMap, mounts it read-only, and sets `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_SCOPED_SA_POOL=1` on the broker, which then mints a short-lived token for the account a request's target cluster maps to and refuses a cluster with no entry (`403`, rule `gcp.scoped-sa.unmapped-scope`) rather than falling back to the wider credential. The list is keyed on `(projectId, location, clusterName)` so a duplicate cluster is rejected at `kubectl apply` rather than crashlooping the broker at startup; entries are bounded at 100 and each component is pattern-validated. **Leave it empty for now**: pool members currently hold no IAM grant, so an armed pool turns every mapped-cluster read into a `Forbidden` — see the caution on the pool section.

The Workload Identity target GSA (`kubeagents-platform-gsa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) is created and bound by the [`kube-agents-iam` Terraform module](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/terraform/modules/kube-agents-iam) with one of these permission sets:

- `read-only` (default)
- `custom` (roles supplied via the installer's `--custom-roles`, the composition's `project_roles`)

## `spec.telemetry`

- `otlpEndpoint` — the OTLP/HTTP collector **base** URL (no `/v1/traces` suffix; the exporters append their own per-signal path). Up to 2048 characters, `http://` or `https://`.

Optional, and omitting it is the point: with the field absent the operator discovers an in-cluster collector, falls back to GKE Managed OpenTelemetry when it cannot establish what the cluster has, and disables export altogether when discovery finds no collector (`otlpEndpointSource: None`). Setting it pins the endpoint and suppresses discovery. The full precedence ladder, the discovery order, and the Helm value that drives LiteLLM and the NetworkPolicy alongside this field are on [Deploy → Telemetry](/kube-agents/deploy/telemetry/#pointing-at-your-own-collector).

## `spec.networkPolicy`

Configures the operator-generated egress `NetworkPolicy`.

- `enabled` (bool, optional) — toggle operator-managed NetworkPolicy generation. Default `true` (unset
  means on). Setting `false` stops generation and deletes the two policies the operator owns for this
  agent, `<name>-gateway-netpol` and the `<name>-fqdn-netpol` `FQDNNetworkPolicy`. Both deletions
  check the owner reference first, so a policy of the same name that the operator did not create
  survives.
- `dnsClusterIPs` ([]string, optional, max 8 items) — pins the cluster DNS Service ClusterIPs in
  rule 1, suppressing dynamic discovery from `kube-system/kube-dns`. Each entry is a bare IPv4 or
  IPv6 address with no prefix. Admission bounds the IPv4 octets and rejects the leading-zero form
  (`010.96.0.10`) that Go's `net.ParseIP` refuses, so the usual typos are apply-time errors; a malformed
  IPv6 literal can still get past it, in which case the operator drops the entry and falls back to
  discovery, and says so in its log.
- `metadataDaemon` (object, optional) — pins the node-local cloud metadata daemon IP in rule 3. Its
  one field, `endpoint`, is required within it, so `metadataDaemon: {}` is rejected; an explicit
  `endpoint: ""` suppresses rule 3 entirely, for datapaths without a post-NAT daemon. Leave it
  unspecified to let the operator discover the container port from the `kube-system/gke-metadata-server`
  DaemonSet on port `metadata-server` (promoting `metadataDaemonIPSource` to `Discovered`). If undiscoverable,
  it falls back to `169.254.169.252` on port `988`. Overriding the endpoint explicitly opts out of port
  discovery and uses port `988`.
- `additionalEgress` ([]EgressRule, optional, max 32 items) — appends custom CIDR and port egress
  rules to the generated policy. A peer CIDR broader than `/12` (IPv4) or `/48` (IPv6) is rejected at
  admission, so that a caller-supplied range cannot be widened into an unrestricted egress bypass.
  One shape gets past that check and is dropped by the operator instead: an IPv4-mapped IPv6 block
  such as `::ffff:0:0/96` is a 128-bit prefix by every textual measure, so it clears the IPv6 floor,
  and the operator re-measures it against the IPv4 floor once it has collapsed it to the IPv4 block
  it means. An `except` block that is not a strict subset of its peer's CIDR is dropped too — the API
  server rejects the whole policy for one that is not — and a rule left with no usable peer is
  dropped whole — a rule carrying ports and no peer would otherwise permit egress to every
  destination. All three are logged, so the operator's log is where a rule that did not take effect
  explains itself.

  A rule's `ports` list is optional, and omitting it is not one of those drops: a rule with peers
  and no ports permits **every** port to those peers, which is what a NetworkPolicy egress rule with
  an empty port list means. Nothing is logged, because nothing was dropped. List the ports unless
  that is what you want.

  A peer's `except` entries may be written bare (`10.0.1.5`, meaning a `/32`) as well as with a
  prefix, the same as `cidr`. Unlike `cidr` there is no prefix floor on them, because an `except`
  has to be a strict subset of its peer to be kept at all.

Annotations (`kubeagents.x-k8s.io/dns-cluster-ip` and `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/metadata-daemon-ip`) remain
available as escape hatches and take precedence over `spec.networkPolicy`.

## `spec.integration`

Enables external integrations. Only the enabled ones need to be present.

- **`googleChat`** — `enabled` (default `false`), `projectId`, `topicName`, `subscriptionName`, `allowedUsers`, `homeChannel`, and `mode` (`default` or `debug`, default `default`). When `enabled`, `projectId`, `topicName`, and `subscriptionName` are required (enforced by a CEL validation rule). Populated by the installer when Google Chat is enabled.
- **`slack`** — `enabled` (default `false`), `botTokenSecretRef` and `appTokenSecretRef` (Secret refs, required when enabled), `allowedUsers`, `homeChannel`, and `homeChannelName`. Populated by the installer when Slack is enabled.
- **`github`** — `gitRepo`, the target GitOps repository URL for the agent environment (up to 2048 characters). Supports HTTPS/HTTP (`https://`, `http://`), SCP-style SSH (`git@...`), SSH/Git protocols (`ssh://`, `git://`), and bare `owner/repo` shorthand (e.g. `gke-labs/kube-agents`). Rejects URLs containing whitespace, control characters, or invalid syntax at admission (`failurePolicy: Fail`). If an invalid URL is encountered during reconciliation, `SETTINGS.md` defaults to `None` and a `Degraded` condition (`Reason: InvalidGitRepoURL`) is surfaced on the resource status. Populated by the installer when a GitOps repository is connected.

See [`k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/platformagent_types.go`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/platformagent_types.go) for the exact struct definitions.

## `status`

The operator writes observed state to the `status` subresource:

| Field                                  | Type     | Purpose                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `phase`                                | string   | Overall state (`Pending`, `Provisioning`, `Ready`, `Failed`).                                       |
| `address`                              | string   | Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the agent service.                                            |
| `lastReconcileTime`                    | time     | Timestamp of the last status update.                                                                |
| `conditions`                           | list     | Standard `metav1.Condition` observations, keyed by `type`.                                          |
| `deploymentStatus.name`                | string   | Name of the underlying Deployment.                                                                  |
| `deploymentStatus.readyReplicas`       | int32    | Number of fully ready replicas.                                                                     |
| `serviceStatus.endpoint`               | string   | Primary URL/IP (with protocol and port) to reach the agent.                                         |
| `storageStatus.bound`                  | bool     | Whether the primary PVC has been provisioned.                                                       |
| `telemetry.otlpEndpoint`               | string   | The OTLP collector the agent was wired to.                                                          |
| `telemetry.otlpEndpointSource`         | string   | Which rung answered: `DeploymentEnv`, `Spec`, `OperatorEnv`, `Discovered`, `None`, or `Default`.    |
| `networkPolicy.generated`              | bool     | Whether the operator-managed NetworkPolicy is active. `false` when disabled, or not yet reconciled. |
| `networkPolicy.dnsClusterIPs`          | []string | The DNS ClusterIPs written into rule 1.                                                             |
| `networkPolicy.dnsClusterIPsSource`    | string   | Which rung answered: `Annotation`, `Spec`, `OperatorEnv`, `Discovered`, or `Default`.               |
| `networkPolicy.metadataDaemonIP`       | string   | The post-NAT daemon IP in rule 3, empty when suppressed.                                            |
| `networkPolicy.metadataDaemonPort`     | int32    | The post-NAT daemon port in rule 3, resolved from live DaemonSet or default (`988`).                |
| `networkPolicy.metadataDaemonIPSource` | string   | Which rung answered: `Annotation`, `Spec`, `OperatorEnv`, `Discovered`, `Default`, or `Suppressed`. |

Three condition types appear in `conditions`, and only the first is always present:

| Type           | Written                                      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ready`        | Always                                       | Tracks `phase`; its `reason` and `message` carry whatever the reconcile is waiting on — including the four spec refusals that park `phase: Degraded` (`RuntimeClassNotFound`, `SplitBrokerStrandsEventWatcher`, `EgressPolicyRequiresSplitBroker`, `EgressAllowlistRefused`). |
| `Degraded`     | Only while degraded                          | Something in the spec cannot be honoured — today, `Reason: InvalidGitRepoURL`. The refusals above ride the `Ready` condition instead of this one.                                                                                                                             |
| `EventWatcher` | Only while `eventWatcher.enabled` is `false` | `status: False`, `Reason: DisabledBySpec`. The emergency stop is still pressed and no cluster events are reaching the agent.                                                                                                                                                  |

`EventWatcher` is absent on a healthy install rather than `True`, deliberately: the operator can say
it asked for a watcher, but nothing here checks that one is alive, and a permanently-`True`
condition would read as a health signal it is not. Disabling the watcher is also not a `Degraded`
state — it is a decision somebody made, and `phase` stays `Ready`.

```console
$ kubectl describe platformagent platform-agent -n kubeagents-system
...
  Conditions:
    Type:     EventWatcher
    Status:   False
    Reason:   DisabledBySpec
    Message:  Cluster event ingestion is disabled by spec.harness.eventWatcher.enabled=false. …
```

## How config reaches each profile

A deployment runs several Hermes **profiles** from one pod: `default` (the Planning Agent front door),
`platform`, and one `cluster-*` profile per managed cluster. The named profiles are each configured
by an overlay merged into an image-built base at startup. The `default` profile is the exception: it
takes the operator's settings by _two_ routes at once — an overlay merged into its config, and a
read-only **managed scope** pinned over it.

A cluster profile is the only one that can take two overlays: the class overlay carries
`tuning.cluster`, which applies to all of them, and a plugin targeting one specific cluster produces
a `profile-<name>` overlay for it as well. The class overlay merges first, so the per-profile file
wins any conflict.

**Why `default` is also pinned.** The pins are the one change-control boundary the front door has:
the agent's own config file is writable, so without them a bad runtime edit survives a restart. (It
is _not_ a security sandbox — see the
[AgentPlugin trust boundary](/kube-agents/reference/security-and-iam/#change-control--safety).)

**What is pinned is narrow, on purpose.** `/etc/hermes` is machine-global — one file for every
profile in the pod, not just `default` — so it carries only what is identical for every profile
_and_ beyond the agent's own repair: `model.*`, `platforms.*`, `approvals.cron_mode` and
`display.platforms`. The reasoning is that as long as a human can reach the agent (`platforms`) and
the agent can reason (`model`), anything else it breaks it can be talked into fixing.

Everything else the operator owns for the front door goes in `profile-default.overlay.yaml`
instead: `plugins.enabled` for AgentPlugins with no `targetProfile`, those plugins' non-gateway
config subtrees, and `spec.harness.tuning`'s `default` limits and `maxInProgress`. Those are
profile-shaped — pinning them machine-globally would hand the front door's settings to every
specialist — and they are all recoverable by an agent that can still talk and still reason.
Nothing the operator renders appears on both routes. What appears on neither, and so stays the
image's alone, is each profile's toolsets, `mcp_servers` and `memory`.

It is also the only profile whose config the _running agent_ writes to: `/sethome` records the home
channel there, the monitoring policy mints `monitoring.install_id`, and slash commands save
preferences. Those two facts pulled in opposite directions, and the managed scope is what resolves
them.

The rendering is published as the `managed-config.yaml` key of the `<agent>-config` ConfigMap and
mounted read-only at `/etc/hermes/config.yaml`. Hermes treats that directory as an administrator
layer and overlays it, **per leaf key**, on top of `$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml` at every load. Three
things enforce it (`hermes_cli/managed_scope.py`):

- `load_config` deep-merges the managed dict on top of the agent's own;
- `save_config` strips every managed leaf before writing, so a save cannot persist one;
- `hermes config set` rejects a managed key by name.

So `$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml` stays an ordinary writable file — `/sethome` and the install id work —
while every leaf the operator renders is authoritative and immutable at runtime. Whatever ends up in
the PVC file, the operator's value is what loads, so a restart always heals. Earlier shapes did not
manage both: mounting the render over `$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml` made the path read-only and failed
every runtime write (`/sethome` with a permission error, the rest silently — issue #658), and
merging it into the file at startup left every merged key mutable, so an agent that repointed
`model.base_url` at nothing kept that across restarts.

`platforms.<platform>.home_channel` is deliberately **not** pinned, so `/sethome` can still set it
from chat. The platform credentials and endpoints that have no `config.yaml` equivalent are pinned
through a companion `/etc/hermes/.env`, which Hermes applies last with `override=True` and refuses to
let the agent overwrite — without that, a container env var would beat the pinned `platforms.*` leaf.

That file also pins one value that is not a credential at all: `API_SERVER_KEY=cluster-internal-trusted`,
the non-secret loopback sentinel the Hermes API server on `127.0.0.1:8642` validates. It is pinned here
because Hermes' stage2 hook generates a random `API_SERVER_KEY` into `$HERMES_HOME/.env` whenever that
file carries none, and the PVC `.env` is applied with `override=True` too — ahead of the container env,
behind `/etc/hermes`. Unpinned, the gateway ends up validating against a value no caller has, and the
credential proxy, the startup probe and every in-pod loopback call get `401 Invalid gateway API key`
(issue #786). The container entrypoint warns at boot when this pin and the container env disagree.
The credential that guards the API from _outside_ is `API_SERVER_EXTERNAL_KEY`, set from
`hermes.apiServerSecretRef`; the sidecar authenticates the caller against it and swaps in the sentinel.

One consequence is worth knowing before you edit `renderConfigYAML`: the managed overlay is a
leaf-level merge, and a list is a leaf, so a list rendered here **replaces** the image's rather than
unioning with it — for every profile at once. That is why the render emits no lists at all today,
and why adding one is the change to think hardest about.

**Why the others get overlays.** Their `config.yaml` is assembled at image build time by merging the
shared defaults with that profile's own overlay, content the operator does not have; a `cluster-*`
config additionally carries a runtime `cluster_identity` stamp that the reconciler matches profiles
to clusters by. Rendering either file in full would fork the source of truth and, for cluster
profiles, strip that identity record.

Every overlay is a key in the one `<agent>-config` ConfigMap, so a change to any of them moves the
config hash and rolls the pod. That restart is required, not incidental: the merge happens once at
startup, so a live ConfigMap update without a restart would be a no-op. The managed key shares the
ConfigMap and so rolls the pod too, though for it the restart is belt-and-braces rather than
required — it is mounted as a directory, not a `subPath`, so the kubelet propagates updates and
Hermes re-reads the file when its mtime or size changes.

Startup is not the only moment a merge happens. Onboarding a cluster scaffolds a new profile without
changing the ConfigMap, so nothing rolls the pod; that profile applies the overlays itself as it is
created. Without it a Cluster Agent created between two pod starts would run on Hermes' own defaults
however the CR is tuned.

**Ordering.** The entrypoint force-syncs each profile's image-owned files first, then merges the
overlays. The reverse order would silently erase every overlay on each restart. The `default`
profile's `config.yaml` is the exception to the force-sync: it is the agent's own file, and a
force-sync is exactly what would throw the runtime's edits away. It is instead seeded from the image
on a fresh volume, and thereafter only back-filled — keys the image declares and the live file has
lost are restored, keys it already holds are left alone. Its overlay is merged after that
back-fill, so the operator's settings are not undone by it.

The platform profile's `config.yaml` becomes a second exception under
[`platformFrontDoor`](#platformfrontdoor), and for the same reason: the gateway is homed there, so
that file is now the one `/sethome` and the monitoring policy write to. It leaves the force-sync
list and is back-filled from the image template instead, on exactly the terms `default` gets — keys
the template declares and the live file has lost are restored, keys it already holds are left
alone. Its overlay merges after that back-fill as it always did. Everything else the image owns in
that profile — the persona files, `cron/`, `skills/`, `governance/`, `hindsight/` — still
force-syncs either way.

**Merge semantics.** These differ between the two mechanisms, which is the easiest thing to get
wrong here. In a startup **overlay** — every profile including `default` — maps merge recursively,
lists union, and scalars are replaced by the overlay; precedence, lowest to highest, is Hermes
built-in default → the value committed in `agents/<persona>/config.yaml` → the operator overlay from
the CR. In the **managed scope** the merge is per leaf key, so a list replaces rather than unions,
and it wins over everything else because it is applied at every load rather than once at startup.

**Two writers, two authorities.** Both `spec.harness.tuning` (operator policy) and an
`AgentPlugin`'s `spec.config` (plugin-supplied) land in the same overlay file, but not with equal
rights. A plugin's config is restricted to `approvals`, `platforms`, and `platform_toolsets`, and
for an untargeted plugin only `platforms` reaches the machine-global managed scope — the rest goes
to the front door's overlay. The `agent` subtree holding the execution limits is dropped from plugin
config and writable only by the operator. That is a coordination boundary rather than a security one — plugin code executes
in-process and could change these at runtime — but it keeps limits with board-wide consequences in
one reviewable place.

## Reconcile behavior

- On create/update, the controller ensures the Deployment, Service, ServiceAccount, and ConfigMaps match the spec.
- On delete, it garbage-collects owned resources.
- The admission webhook (behind cert-manager) validates the spec before it's persisted; it enforces at most one `PlatformAgent` per project, forbids sensitive environment variable overrides (`API_SERVER_KEY`, `HERMES_HOME`) and privileged containers/volumes (`hostPath`), requires each `imagePullSecrets` entry to name a Secret, and acts as a name-based tripwire against obvious privileged service account names (`cluster-admin`, `system:admin`). Note that full RBAC least-privilege enforcement is handled by controller- and pipeline-level policies rather than the admission webhook.
- The `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/prevent-deletion: "true"` annotation on a `PlatformAgent` blocks deletion of the resource via the validating webhook (`ValidateDelete`). This serves as an accidental-deletion guardrail rather than an authorization control — `ValidateUpdate` does not block removing the annotation, so any principal with update permissions can patch the annotation off before deleting.
- The Helm chart renders and applies the CR (the install engine drives it through `terraform apply`); you can also edit it directly with `kubectl edit`.
