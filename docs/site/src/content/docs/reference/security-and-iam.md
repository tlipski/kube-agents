## What the agent can and cannot do

This is the canonical answer. Other pages summarize it and link here; if they appear to disagree, this page is correct.

"Is the agent read-only?" has **three different answers depending on which plane you mean.** Conflating them is the most common misreading of this project's security posture.

| Plane                         | What it governs                                                   | Can the agent write?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Kubernetes RBAC** (the KSA) | Everything the agent does against a cluster's Kubernetes API      | **No** for workloads and cluster state — read-only in every configuration apart from a leader-election housekeeping Role confined to its own namespace, and it cannot read Secrets. Enforced by RBAC.                                |
| **GCP IAM** (the GSA)         | GKE/Google Cloud control-plane calls, including via the `gke` MCP | **No, with the default `read-only` permission set** — the only other set the install offers is `custom`, whose roles you choose yourself. Enforced by IAM, chosen at install time.                                                   |
| **The GitOps path**           | Changes to your infrastructure-as-code repository                 | Yes — by opening a pull request a human must review and merge. Enforced by the credential proxy, which refuses the agent the GitHub write verbs (merge, approve, REST mutation, workflow and release triggers, repo administration). |

### What that means in practice

- **Workloads and cluster state cannot be mutated through the Kubernetes API by this agent.** The KSA's only write grant is the housekeeping Role `kubeagents:leader:<namespace>:<name>` — write on leader-election `leases` plus `get`/`patch` on `pods`, both confined to the agent's own namespace. Beyond that it holds no write verb (see [Kubernetes RBAC](#kubernetes-rbac)). This holds regardless of any other setting.
- **GCP control-plane mutation is enforced off by default.** The default `read-only` permission set gives the GSA viewer roles only, so cloud-side writes fail at IAM. The install no longer offers an admin bundle — `custom` is the only way to widen this, and it requires you to name every role. If you do grant write roles that way, the agent's `gke` MCP server proxies `container.googleapis.com` and exposes cluster-management tools, and what stops the agent using them is its **persona** (`SOUL.md §1`, "automation first" — infrastructure changes go through Git), not a permission boundary.
- **Persona rules are guidance, not enforcement.** A prompt-injection or reasoning failure is bounded by IAM, not by `SOUL.md`. Keep the default `read-only` set if "read-only on the cloud plane" must be an enforced property of the deployment rather than an intended behaviour of the model (see [Configuring read-only mode](#configuring-read-only-auditing-mode)).
- **The intended write path is always GitOps** — the agent proposes, a human merges, your reconciler applies. The second half is enforced rather than intended: the credential proxy refuses `gh pr merge`, `gh pr review --approve`, mutating `gh api` calls, workflow and release triggers, and repository administration, so the actor that opens a pull request cannot also complete it. See [Secure write path](#secure-write-path-gitops) and [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/) for the rule ids.
- **The chat front door holds no infrastructure tools at all.** Chat ingress terminates at the Planning Agent (the pod's `default` Hermes profile), whose config pins every surface to routing, kanban-delegation, and per-user memory tools only — no GKE, file, or GitOps write tools. A prompt injected through chat must still be delegated to the Platform Agent, where the IAM and RBAC boundaries above apply. The experimental [`platformFrontDoor`](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/#platformfrontdoor) flag gives that up on purpose: it points chat ingress straight at the Platform Agent's toolset, so this row does not hold on an install that has turned it on. It also hands that profile's `config.yaml` to the agent, so the security and approval keys in it (`security.tirith_enabled`, `approvals.*`) stop being restored from the image on every restart. It is off by default and unsupported. See [ChatOps](/kube-agents/concepts/chatops/).
- **Cluster Agents are scoped-down, not scoped-up.** Each per-cluster [Cluster Agent](/kube-agents/concepts/cluster-agents/) profile shares the pod's identity (same KSA/GSA, so the same IAM and RBAC ceilings apply), but its config template exposes only the read-only `gke` and `developer_knowledge` MCP servers — no `platform_control`, no GitOps write path — and its `KUBECONFIG` is pinned to one cluster. It proposes fixes back over the kanban card; only the Platform Agent can turn them into PRs.
  - **The management cluster now has a Cluster Agent too,** so one of these profiles is scoped to the cluster kube-agents itself runs in and can read the harness's own namespace — including the namespace holding `platform-agent-secrets`. **How far that reach goes is set by the GSA's permission set, not by the Kubernetes RBAC row above.** A Cluster Agent does not reach its cluster as the KSA: `cluster_agent_profile.create_profile` runs `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` and pins the resulting kubeconfig, so its Kubernetes API calls authenticate as the pod's GSA and the `kubeagents:minimal:*` ClusterRole does not bound them. (On an install that has armed the [scoped service account pool](#the-scoped-service-account-pool), `kubectl` under such a kubeconfig authenticates as the cluster's pool member instead — moot today, since the pool is suspended and off by default.) On the default `read-only` set (`roles/container.clusterViewer`, `roles/container.viewer`) that means the harness's own workloads, their logs, ConfigMaps and events, and **not** its Secrets. On a `custom` set that names an admin role it means the full Kubernetes API on that cluster, **Secrets included** — so on such an install this profile can read the agent's own credentials. That reach is accepted on purpose on the default set: the management cluster's workloads fail like any other cluster's, and the agent that triages an event has to be the one scoped to the cluster that raised it. If it is not acceptable on your install — most sharply if you have widened the GSA through `custom` — add the cluster's name to the `cluster-agent-reconcile` job's `RECONCILE_EXCLUDE`; the next reconcile then prunes the profile.

> The [end-state design](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/docs/architecture/01-vision-scope.md) goes further: agents stay read-only on cloud APIs in every configuration, and the `create_cluster` tool is withdrawn. Removing the `gke-admin` bundle closed the one-word path to a writable GSA, but it does not get there on its own — `custom` can still be pointed at admin roles, and the tool is still present. That part is a target, not current behaviour.

The rest of this page details the two enforced planes.

## Identity model

The agent uses [GKE Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) to bind its in-cluster KSA to a GSA, so no static GCP key ever lands in the cluster.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph K8s["GKE cluster"]
        Pod["Platform Agent pod"] --> KSA["KSA<br/>kubeagents-platform-agent"]
    end
    subgraph IAM["GCP IAM"]
        KSA -->|Workload Identity| GSA["GSA<br/>kubeagents-platform-gsa@PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com"]
        GSA -->|IAM roles| Res["GCP / GKE resources"]
    end
```

The IAM side of the binding is provisioned by the [`kube-agents-iam` Terraform module](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/terraform/modules/kube-agents-iam) (instantiated by the `terraform/examples/full-install` composition the installer drives), which grants `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` on the GSA to the KSA member `<project>.svc.id.goog[kubeagents-system/kubeagents-platform-agent]`. The KSA-side annotation `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: kubeagents-platform-gsa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` is applied by the operator from `spec.security.serviceAccountAnnotations` on the [`PlatformAgent` CR](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/).

## GCP IAM permission sets

The install grants the agent GSA one of two permission sets. Both entry points choose from the same vocabulary, and `read-only` is the default in each: the installer asks the question — or takes `--permission-set` / `--custom-roles` — and records the answer in `vars.sh` as `PLATFORM_AGENT_PERMISSION_SET` before generating `terraform.tfvars`; a hand-driven Terraform composition takes the same two values in its `permission_set` variable, with `custom` requiring a `project_roles` list (setting `project_roles` explicitly overrides `permission_set` either way).

| Permission set | `PLATFORM_AGENT_PERMISSION_SET` | Use it when                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **read-only**  | `read-only` (default)           | Auditing / monitoring only — no GCP write capability.         |
| **custom**     | `custom`                        | You supply the exact roles via `PLATFORM_AGENT_CUSTOM_ROLES`. |

### Roles per set

The default **read-only** set binds viewer roles only:

- `roles/container.clusterViewer`, `roles/container.viewer` — read-only GKE.
- `roles/compute.viewer` — read-only compute, reservations, machine types, and quota advice.
- `roles/monitoring.viewer`, `roles/logging.viewer` — read-only telemetry.
- `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` — act as service accounts when running jobs.
- `roles/iam.securityReviewer` — read IAM policy for review.
- `roles/mcp.toolUser` — call the GKE MCP server.

`roles/container.viewer` is project-wide and unconditioned, so it reads Kubernetes objects in **every** cluster in the project. The [scoped service account pool](#the-scoped-service-account-pool) is where that narrowing is designed to land — suspended as of 2026-08-12, so today nothing narrows it; the pool section says why.

The **custom** set binds exactly the roles listed in `--custom-roles` (space- or comma-separated; the installer prompts for it and requires a non-empty value when this set is selected), carried as the composition's `project_roles` list — none of the built-in role bundles are added.

If that list names a role like `roles/container.admin`, the installer says so at the point of choice — it is the authority the removed bundle granted, reached the long way round — and continues. It is your call to make, not the installer's.

### Why there is no `gke-admin` set

There used to be a third set, `gke-admin`, which bound `roles/container.clusterAdmin` and `roles/container.admin`. It was removed rather than deprecated because it did not simply widen the ceiling — it removed one:

- **GKE authorizes an action if _either_ IAM or Kubernetes RBAC allows it** ([Access control](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control)). A GSA holding `roles/container.admin` is authorized by IAM whatever the KSA's RBAC says, so the read-only Kubernetes footprint below stops constraining anything the agent reaches through that identity.
- **`roles/container.admin` is the one predefined GKE role that carries `container.clusters.impersonate`** — `roles/container.clusterAdmin` does not. GKE grants IAM roles at the project level; a cluster is not a resource an IAM policy attaches to, so "an IAM role grants privileges across all clusters in the project". The impersonation therefore cannot be narrowed to one cluster.

`custom` remains, so a deployment that genuinely needs broad roles still has a supported path — it just has to name each role, which makes the grant explicit and reviewable. Setting `PLATFORM_AGENT_PERMISSION_SET=gke-admin`, or `permission_set = "gke-admin"` in `terraform.tfvars`, now fails with an error rather than being silently downgraded. Re-running the install does not strip roles it no longer grants, so an existing GSA has to be brought back by hand — see below.

## The scoped service account pool

:::caution[Grants nothing as of 2026-08-12]
The pool provisions its service accounts, and those accounts hold no IAM grant. Each was scoped by an IAM Condition on the cluster's `resource.name`, and that grants nothing for Kubernetes object operations — measured across four condition spellings, one of which asserted only that the call was a GKE call. Deleting the condition is not the repair: un-conditioned, the same binding is project-wide `roles/container.viewer`, which is the ceiling the pool exists to remove. Both are gone.

So the pool is empty by default and the broker runs on the agent's own identity, as it did before. There are two ways to arm it and both should stay off: `scoped_clusters` on the Terraform side, and `platformAgent.security.scopedServiceAccounts` in the chart, which is what an install that writes the `PlatformAgent` CR by hand would set. Authority arrives with per-cluster Kubernetes RBAC, which is a separate change.
:::

A Terraform install can provision one service account per GKE cluster. The credential broker then mints a short-lived token for the account a `kubectl` request's target cluster maps to, rather than running it on the agent's own identity.

Set it with the `scoped_clusters` variable, on the [`kube-agents-iam`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/terraform/modules/kube-agents-iam) module or on `terraform/examples/full-install`, which passes it through. A non-empty list provisions the accounts and arms the broker. A cluster that is not in the list is then refused rather than served by a wider credential, so adding a cluster to the fleet without adding it here produces a refusal naming the missing scope.

The narrowing that was to go with it is suspended. The agent's own GSA was to drop `roles/container.viewer` whenever the pool was populated, keeping `roles/container.clusterViewer` — able to enumerate clusters and run `get-credentials`, unable to read anything inside one. The two changes are coupled because neither is safe alone: narrowing the agent while the pool grants nothing breaks every read, and arming the pool while the agent stays wide leaves the ceiling the pool exists to remove. As of 2026-08-12 both are off, and `tests/test_scoped_sa_pool_iam.py` fails on either half.

The module grants the agent `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` **on each pool member as a resource**, never at project level. At project level that role would let the agent mint a token for any service account in the project, which would make the pool decorative.

The mapping reaches the broker through `spec.security.scopedServiceAccounts` on the [`PlatformAgent` CR](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/). The operator renders it into the credential-proxy ConfigMap and sets `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_SCOPED_SA_POOL` on the broker container. That variable is written in both directions, so which credential mode an install is in is readable from the Deployment rather than inferred from what is absent.

**What the pool does not cover.** It scopes `kubectl`, and only `kubectl`, through the credential broker. `gcloud` also goes through the broker but stays on the agent's own identity — it names its target in argv, and deciding scope from argv would put a parser where the boundary belongs — and so do `git` and `gh`. And the `gke` MCP server proxies to `container.googleapis.com/mcp` from the agent container on the ambient Workload Identity credential and never reaches the broker at all. What bounds both of those paths is the size of the agent's own grant — which is the other half of why `roles/container.viewer` was to come off it.

## Kubernetes RBAC

Independently of the GCP permission set, the operator grants the agent KSA a **read-only** footprint on the Kubernetes API, plus one namespaced housekeeping Role. It creates three bindings (see [`platformagent_manifests.go`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go)):

| Binding                                 | Role                       | Grants                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kubeagents:minimal:<namespace>:<name>` | custom minimal ClusterRole | Cluster-wide read access (`get`/`list`/`watch`) to audit resources (nodes, pods, deployments, configmaps, services, etc.) — **excluding Secrets and RBAC**. |
| `kubeagents:local:<namespace>:<name>`   | custom namespaced Role     | Read access (`get`/`list`/`watch`) to `PlatformAgent` CRs in the agent's **own namespace only**.                                                            |
| `kubeagents:leader:<namespace>:<name>`  | custom namespaced Role     | Housekeeping in the agent's **own namespace only**: write on `coordination.k8s.io` `leases` (leader election) and `get`/`patch` on `pods`.                  |

For the default CR (`platform-agent` in `kubeagents-system`) the bindings resolve to `kubeagents:minimal:kubeagents-system:platform-agent`, `kubeagents:local:kubeagents-system:platform-agent`, and `kubeagents:leader:kubeagents-system:platform-agent`.

The Kubernetes `minimal` and `local` roles carry no write verbs (`create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`) and grant no read access to Secrets or cluster RBAC. (The GCP IAM `read-only` permission set independently provides cluster-viewer read via Cloud IAM for audits connecting through `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`.) The only write grant anywhere in Kubernetes RBAC is the `leader` Role, and it is confined to the agent's own namespace — leader-election `leases`, plus `get`/`patch` on `pods` there. The agent cannot modify Deployments, Services, or namespaces, and it cannot read Secret values — if a resource it proposes needs a Secret, it references the Secret by name rather than reading its contents.

Verify the bindings on a running cluster:

```bash
kubectl describe clusterrolebinding kubeagents:minimal:kubeagents-system:platform-agent
kubectl describe rolebinding -n kubeagents-system kubeagents:local:kubeagents-system:platform-agent
kubectl describe rolebinding -n kubeagents-system kubeagents:leader:kubeagents-system:platform-agent
```

### The admission backstop on agent RBAC

The RBAC above is what the operator creates. Alongside it, two cluster-scoped `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` objects reject some agent RBAC at apply time, whoever applies it. One source, [`k8s-operator/config/admission/agent-rbac-policy.yaml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/config/admission/agent-rbac-policy.yaml), and which installs apply it depends on how you install:

| Install method                                                                | Ships the policies?                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The install engine — `install.sh`, or Terraform + Helm directly (Methods 0/1) | **Yes on Kubernetes 1.30+** — `templates/agent-rbac-admission-policy.yaml`, gated on `admissionPolicy.enabled` (default on) and on the cluster version. |
| Manual `make install && make deploy` (Method 2)                               | **No** — apply the source yourself; INSTALL.md Method 2 Step 4 has the command.                                                                         |

They are outside the kustomize overlay on purpose: its `namePrefix` rewrites each policy's name but not the `spec.policyName` its binding refers to, which would leave the bindings pointing at nothing and the policies inert with no error. A plain `kubectl apply` has no such transform.

They need Kubernetes 1.30 or later, where the policy API reached `v1`. The chart template checks the cluster's version as well as the values gate, so on 1.29 it renders nothing rather than failing the install — which also means an install there is not backstopped at admission and nothing says so at the time.

**What they govern is narrower than "agent RBAC", and the gap is worth knowing before you rely on them.** Policy 1 selects only objects carrying the `kube-agents/tier` label. Nothing the operator creates carries it — `commonLabels()` stamps the four `app.kubernetes.io/*` labels and no tier — so on a default install with no GitOps overlay, **policy 1 matches nothing at all**. It is a backstop on the RBAC your overlay writes, not on the RBAC the operator mints. Policy 2 does see the operator's `kubeagents:minimal:*` ClusterRoleBinding, whose subject ends in `-agent`, and deliberately exempts it: `reconcileRBAC` has no namespace-tier path, so the one case policy 2 denies is one the operator cannot produce.

| Policy                            | Governs                                                                          | Denies                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kube-agents-agent-readonly`      | `Role` / `ClusterRole` labelled `kube-agents/tier`                               | Any verb outside `get`/`list`/`watch`; any rule reaching `secrets`; a `ClusterRole` for the `developer-team` tier. |
| `kube-agents-agent-binding-scope` | `RoleBinding` / `ClusterRoleBinding` whose subject is a `*-agent` ServiceAccount | A `ClusterRoleBinding` to `developer-team-agent`.                                                                  |

What they do **not** cover, stated plainly because a backstop misread as complete is worse than none:

- **They cannot check the role a binding points at.** CEL in a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` sees only the object being admitted, so an unlabelled write `Role` bound to an agent ServiceAccount is admitted. Closing that needs a cross-object webhook, which is not built.
- **The content policy is label-selected.** `kube-agents-agent-readonly` only looks at objects carrying `kube-agents/tier`. A hand-written manifest that omits the label is not examined at all; pull-request review is what catches that. The binding-scope policy is not evadable that way: it keys on the ServiceAccount being privileged, which the binding cannot omit. Nor by _adding_ something — its one exemption, for the operator's own reconcile, matches on `request.userInfo.username`, which the API server fills in from the authenticated request and no manifest can carry. That distinction is load-bearing rather than pedantic: `matchConditions` are ANDed, so a false one drops the object from the policy altogether, and an exemption an author could satisfy from inside the manifest would be a bypass of the whole rule rather than a carve-out from it.
- **Policy 2 denies exactly one ServiceAccount name.** A cluster-scoped binding to any other agent ServiceAccount is admitted. Combined with the label point above, this means an unlabelled `ClusterRole` granting `*` on `*`, bound to the agent's own ServiceAccount, is admitted by both policies on a default install. Pull-request review on the GitOps repository is the control for that, which is what the [branch-protection guidance](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/examples/gitops-repo/.github/branch-protection.md) shipped with the example overlay is for.
- **Policy 2 only examines `kind: ServiceAccount` subjects.** A binding whose subject is a `kind: Group` — `system:serviceaccounts:team-x`, say — is not selected. The subject is unforgeable for the kinds the policy looks at; choosing a different kind steps outside them.
- **They govern agent RBAC, not the operator's own.** The controller's ClusterRole below is unlabelled and out of scope by design.

### The operator controller is a separate identity

Everything above describes the _agent_. The controller-manager that reconciles `PlatformAgent` CRs runs under its own KSA, `kubeagents-controller` (the kustomize `namePrefix: kubeagents-` applied to the base `controller` ServiceAccount), and its Kubernetes permissions are the Kubebuilder-generated ClusterRole in [`k8s-operator/config/rbac/role.yaml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/config/rbac/role.yaml) (regenerated with `make manifests`): write access to the object kinds it reconciles for the agent pod — Deployments/StatefulSets, ServiceAccounts, Services, ConfigMaps, PVCs, NetworkPolicies, PodDisruptionBudgets, and the agent RBAC objects above — plus read-only access to what it merely watches (nodes, namespaces, CRDs, RuntimeClasses). Unlike the agent, the controller has no GCP identity: no install path creates a controller GSA or Workload Identity binding for it (the `CONTROLLER_GSA_NAME` default in `scripts/common.sh` is a leftover of older installs that did bind one).

### The Vertex AI gateway is a separate identity

With `MODEL_PROVIDER=vertex_ai` the LiteLLM gateway gets its own KSA (`kubeagents-litellm`) bound to its own GSA (`kubeagents-litellm-gsa`), holding exactly one role — `roles/aiplatform.user` on the serving project — and nothing else. It is deliberately not the agent's identity: the gateway is a network-exposed proxy that forwards attacker-influenceable prompt content, so it is scoped to calling models and cannot touch GKE, logging, or the GitOps path. With `model_provider = "vertex_ai"` the `full-install` composition instantiates the [`kube-agents-iam`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/terraform/modules/kube-agents-iam) module a second time for the gateway — the GSA, `roles/aiplatform.user` on the serving project, and the Workload Identity binding — and the Helm chart renders the annotated KSA; because the pair is Terraform-managed, switching away from `vertex_ai` removes it on the next apply and leaves no orphan. The other providers give the gateway no GCP identity at all — it authenticates with an API key from `platform-agent-secrets`.

## Configuring read-only (auditing) mode

`read-only` is the install default, so a fresh install already runs in this posture. To pin it explicitly, or to bring a deployment provisioned with the removed `gke-admin` set back to it:

- **With the installer (recommended)** — accept the default option in its permission-set menu, or pass it explicitly (a re-run reconciles the change through one `terraform apply`):

  ```bash
  ./install.sh --permission-set=read-only
  ```

- **With a hand-driven Terraform composition** — set `permission_set = "read-only"` in `terraform.tfvars` and apply.

- **On an existing GSA provisioned with the old `gke-admin` set** — re-running the install will not strip roles it no longer grants, so swap the admin roles for viewers by hand:

  ```bash
  PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"

  The eight are `local.read_only_roles` in `terraform/examples/full-install/main.tf`, and a unit test pins the verifier's copy to them.

The Kubernetes RBAC above is already read-only in every mode, so no cluster-side change is needed. Neither is the GitOps path affected: the agent proposes pull requests under every permission set, because what makes it propose rather than apply is Kubernetes RBAC, not the IAM set.

## Secure write path: GitOps

Because the agent's Kubernetes RBAC is read-only, remediations are proposed rather than applied:

1. The agent invokes the [`submit-suggestion`](/kube-agents/concepts/declarative-workflow/) skill with a proposed diff — or, for a scheduled fleet audit, the `fleet-audit` skill with a validated findings file.
2. The skill's helper commits to a topic branch and calls [Minty](/kube-agents/deploy/token-minter/) for a short-lived GitHub App token.
3. It opens a Pull Request against your GitOps repository. `fleet-audit` publishes its report as one GitHub issue per audit stream — the ledger, rewritten in place each run — and opens a narrow Pull Request only for a finding whose fix is a manifest, linked back to that ledger.
4. A human reviews and merges; a GitOps controller (Argo CD, Flux) reconciles the change into the cluster.

Both paths share the same guardrails: blanket staging (`git add .` / `git add -A`) is refused, and force-pushes to `main`, `master`, and `production` are hard-blocked.

The agent never has direct write access to running infrastructure — see [Declarative workflow](/kube-agents/concepts/declarative-workflow/).

## Change control & safety

- **No direct cluster writes.** Enforced by RBAC (above) and by the persona's automation-first stance — the agent does not `kubectl apply`; it opens PRs. See [Platform Agent](/kube-agents/concepts/platform-agent/).
- **No merging its own work.** The agent may open pull requests, issues, and comments; the proxy refuses the verbs that would let it merge, approve, trigger a pipeline, or administer the repository. This is what keeps the review gate a gate rather than a convention. See [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/).
- **No credentials in the sandbox.** API keys, chat tokens, and ServiceAccount tokens live only in the Envoy credential-proxy sidecar; the agent container gets wrapper CLIs that forward through a policy-enforced local proxy. See [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/).

  **This is a filesystem and environment boundary, not a network one, and the default install does not close it.** The sidecar shares a Pod — and therefore a network namespace and one Pod identity — with the sandbox, so the agent container can reach the link-local metadata server at `169.254.169.254` and mint the Workload Identity service account's token itself, bypassing the proxy and every command policy in front of it. Two opt-in fields work on that path, `spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod` and `spec.security.egressPolicy: Allowlist`, and **both default to off**. Even with both on, the `*-gateway-netpol` described below still permits the metadata path to the same Pod, because NetworkPolicies are additive. What they cost, what they break, and what is still open are on [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/#denying-the-sandbox-the-metadata-server), which owns the topic.

- **The prompt material baked into the image is the material it was built with.** A `SKILL.md` is instructions the agent follows, a `SOUL.md` is the persona it follows them as, and a skill's `scripts/*.py` runs with the agent's credentials, so all three are part of the trust boundary. Ownership is the barrier: the image's specialist templates (`/opt/platform-template` and `/opt/cluster-template` in full — persona, config and skills alike), the shared skill tree at `/opt/hermes/skills`, the Hermes plugins at `/opt/hermes/plugins` (Python imported into the agent's own process), the shared scripts at `/opt/defaults/scripts` (which include the manifest checker itself, in the sidecar as well as the agent container) and the Chat Agent's config template at `/opt/chat-template` (which every boot back-fills absent keys into the live default profile from) are root-owned while the agent runs as uid 10000, so the agent cannot rewrite what the entrypoint installs into every profile on the next boot. That sits beneath `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, which the operator already sets on every container it builds; ownership is what still holds for the image run outside this operator, for a container given a writable root filesystem, and during the build itself. A build-time manifest is the detection half: the build writes a SHA-256 of every file in each baked skill tree into that tree, and the entrypoint re-checks it at startup before any of it is copied to a profile — [Container entrypoint](/kube-agents/deploy/docker-images/#container-entrypoint) is canonical for what happens when it does not match. The personas, plugins, shared scripts and config template get the barrier but not the hash: they are covered against the agent, not against a corrupted layer. What this does **not** cover: the per-profile copies on the agent's `$HERMES_HOME` volume, legitimately rewritten after the copy by profile scaffolding and by the hourly cluster reconcile, so they have no fixed checksum to compare against; the rest of `/opt/defaults`, the Chat Agent's own default profile, which stays agent-owned and is still read back from the image after the boot copy (`cron/jobs.json` by the cron reconciler, `plugins/` by profile scaffolding and by the OTel config generator, `onboarding/` by the onboarding plugin); the rest of `/opt/hermes` — `gateway/`, `tools/` and the venv interpreter — whose ownership comes from the Hermes base image and which this build does not assert; skills a plugin brings in, which arrive from an OCI image rather than this one; and tampering by anything running as root inside the pod. The first three are residue that only the read-only root filesystem closes. Read it as an integrity check on the image, backed by an ownership barrier — not as a runtime sandbox.
- **Network isolation and egress boundaries.** The Platform Agent is protected by restrictive Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` manifests ([`deploy/kustomize/platform/`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/deploy/kustomize/platform) in Kustomize mode, or `*-gateway-netpol` via the operator):
  - **Ingress:** Restricted to essential Hermes API (`8642`), Envoy Credential Proxy API (`8643`), and conditionally dashboard (`9119`) ports from pods within the agent's own namespace (`podSelector: {}`).
  - **Egress (Internal Services):** DNS on TCP/UDP port `53` to CoreDNS/NodeLocal DNS pods, the classic Service-CIDR ClusterIP (`10.96.0.10/32`), and any address outside the private ranges the external `443` rule denies — a static manifest cannot know which ClusterIP a cluster's service range yields (newer GKE clusters allocate from public space, e.g. `34.118.224.0/20`), while the operator-generated policy resolves the actual cluster DNS ClusterIP instead. Also allowlisted: the GCP Workload Identity metadata server (`169.254.169.254/32` on TCP port `80`), GKE Workload Identity daemon (TCP port `988` — resolved dynamically by the operator from the `kube-system/gke-metadata-server` DaemonSet on Dataplane V2 / Workload Identity clusters — to `169.254.169.254/32` and `169.254.169.252/32` on Dataplane V1, where the node DNATs the metadata destination before `NetworkPolicy` is evaluated; ports `8080` and `987` ALTS DirectPath are omitted under least privilege; see [Kustomize deployment](/kube-agents/deploy/kustomize/#configuring-networkpolicy-for-gke-private-clusters-dataplane-v2--custom-cidrs)), LiteLLM Gateway and Standalone Replay pods (`app: litellm` and `app: standalone-replay` on TCP ports `80`, `4000`, and `8080`), vLLM inference servers (`app: gemma-server` on TCP ports `80` and `8000`), GitHub Token Minter pods (`app: github-token-minter` on TCP port `8080`), and — when the agent is exporting telemetry — the resolved collector's namespace on TCP ports `4317`/`4318` (`gke-managed-otel` by default). The operator omits that last rule entirely when `status.telemetry.otlpEndpointSource` is `None`, meaning discovery found no collector and the agent exports nothing; the static Kustomize manifests carry `gke-managed-otel` unconditionally. The operator-generated policy carries one further rule the Kustomize manifests have no counterpart for: the Hindsight memory API (`app.kubernetes.io/name: hindsight` **and** `app.kubernetes.io/component: api` on TCP port `8888`, so it does not also reach the Postgres pod, which carries the same name label). It is rendered unconditionally and matches no pod on an install that did not choose a Hindsight-backed memory provider.
  - **Egress (Control Plane, Fleet & External):** Allowlisted to the internal Kubernetes Control Plane API server (`10.96.0.1/32` and resolved control plane endpoints on TCP ports `443`/`6443`/`8443`, as well as remote private fleet cluster CIDRs and PSC endpoints configured via `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/apiserver-cidr` / `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/custom-egress-cidrs`), and external HTTPS destinations (`0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0` on TCP port `443` excluding private subnets `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, and `100.64.0.0/10` to block internal lateral movement).
  - **Defense-in-Depth Layering:** Environments requiring stricter egress control over HTTPS (`443`) should combine this with Private Google Access / VPC Service Controls CIDR blocks or FQDN-based egress filtering (e.g., `FQDNNetworkPolicy` on Dataplane V2).
  - **How the egress boundary can move.** Three `PlatformAgent` spec fields move it from the CR: `spec.networkPolicy.enabled: false` stops the operator generating a policy at all and deletes the two it owns, leaving the agent pod with whatever egress the cluster's other policies allow; `spec.networkPolicy.additionalEgress` appends caller-supplied CIDR and port rules to the generated policy, bounded at 32 rules and by a `/12` (IPv4) / `/48` (IPv6) prefix floor; and `spec.security.egressAllowlist` (live only behind `egressPolicy: Allowlist` and the split broker) adds `extraRules` to the second policy selecting the same pod — metadata-guarded and refused loudly when a rule reaches a metadata address, but with no width floor of its own (see [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/#denying-the-sandbox-the-metadata-server)). That floor bounds how **wide** a peer range may be, not **which** host it reaches: `169.254.169.254/32` clears a `/12` trivially, so a rule can put back the ALTS DirectPath port `8080` that the metadata rule omits, and `10.0.0.0/12` on `10250` reaches every kubelet in that range. A rule that omits `ports` altogether opens every port to its peers. All three are `PlatformAgent` spec fields, so write access to the CR is write access to the egress boundary — treat it the way the `AgentPlugin` note below asks you to treat plugin creation. The agent cannot take that route against itself: its own ServiceAccount holds `get`, `list`, and `watch` on `platformagents` and no write verb. A fourth route is dynamic discovery: rule 3's port is resolved by the operator from the `kube-system/gke-metadata-server` DaemonSet (defaulting to `988`, with non-standard ports logged). Write access to that DaemonSet is confined to cluster administrators with `kube-system` privileges; the agent's ServiceAccount has no permissions to modify DaemonSets. See [PlatformAgent CRD](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/#specnetworkpolicy).
- **One agent per project.** The admission webhook rejects a second `PlatformAgent` CR, so a cluster can't accumulate agents with overlapping scope. See [PlatformAgent CRD](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/).
- **Human sign-off for destructive ops.** Cluster deletion, tenant offboarding, and broad IAM revocation always require explicit human approval, regardless of any "just do it" phrasing.
- **Unattended runs waive the prompt, not the checks — and the scan has gaps.** `approvals.cron_mode: approve` skips the interactive approval prompt for scheduled runs, because no human is at the keyboard to answer it. The hardline floor (`rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, fork bombs, and nine more), the sudo-stdin guard, and any `approvals.deny` globs still apply, and commands still go through the Tirith content scan unless `approvals.cron_scan: false` opts the profile out. [Autonomous watchdogs](/kube-agents/concepts/autonomous-watchdogs/) is canonical for how that scan behaves and what it catches; what belongs on this page is what it does **not** reach. A pure-ASCII lookalike TLD and terminal escape injection get through both layers. And `execute_code` is auto-approved under `cron_mode: approve` without a content scan at all — Tirith reads POSIX shell, so handing it a Python script would produce noise rather than a verdict — which leaves a scheduled Platform Agent run able to reach `subprocess` unscanned (`deploy/docker/patches/cron_tirith_scan.py`); closing that needs a different scanner, not this one. The Planning Agent cannot take that route: `code_execution` is in its `disabled_toolsets`.
- **A pull-request comment can wake the agent, and write access is what decides whether it may.** `github-repo-watcher` polls the agent's own open pull requests and spawns a worker turn when a comment addresses it with `/agent …` or an `@`-mention. That is unattended ingress from a thread anyone with a GitHub account can write in, so the trust decision is the commenting account's **write access to the repository** — resolved by the forge, and re-checked by the worker before it posts rather than left to the prompt. A comment from anyone else cannot direct the agent, but it is not kept away from the model either, and that distinction is the one to hold on to. It normally earns one canned refusal posted by the sweep, with no worker turn spent — bounded at `PR_AGENT_MAX_PER_TICK` (3) refusals a tick and `PR_AGENT_MAX_REFUSALS_PER_PR` (10) a pull request, past which the refusal is dropped rather than posted, silently, and in the per-pull-request case for good. A request the per-tick cap dropped is still unanswered, so it reaches the worker on a later dispatch; the only verdict available to it there is the same refusal. Untrusted comment _text_ reaches the model routinely: the whole thread travels with any request on that pull request, because a question is only answerable against the discussion around it. An untrusted account can therefore put words in front of the model. What it cannot do is make the agent act on them. An unresolved permission lookup is held for the next tick rather than treated as either answer, and cannot be refused at all — a refusal is permanent, and a proxy fault must not silence a maintainer. Three things bound the blast radius even for a trusted reviewer: the request runs within the authority the agent already has and cannot widen it, redirect it at another repository, or overturn a refusal; a change goes on that pull request's own branch through the same `submit-suggestion` path and its guardrails, never to `main` and never as a second pull request; and `agent:ignore` on a pull request stops the agent posting there at all. Comment text is data, never instruction. [`docs/designs/pr-comment-conversation.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/docs/designs/pr-comment-conversation.md) is canonical for the trigger grammar, the marker scheme, and the per-tick and per-pull-request bounds.
- **An issue can wake the agent too, and its text is sanitized before the model sees it.** `github-repo-watcher` polls unaddressed open issues and files a card that dispatches `github-issue-resolver`. Anyone with a GitHub account can open an issue, so the title, body, and every comment are unattended ingress on the same footing as the pull-request thread above — but the handling differs. `resolver.py` strips control, zero-width, and bidirectional characters and rewrites counterfeit delimiters before wrapping the text in `<untrusted_title>` / `<untrusted_body>` / `<untrusted_comment>` boundary tags, so the demarcation is enforced in code rather than asked for in a prompt. An issue that asks the agent to change something is escalated to `status:escalation-needed` rather than acted on, but that is the agent's reading of the issue and nothing grades it for them — what actually confines the resolver is that its investigation step is read-only and its only writes are a comment and a label. Issue text is data, never instruction. [`agents/platform/skills/github-issue-resolver/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/agents/platform/skills/github-issue-resolver/SKILL.md) is canonical for the boundary rules.
- **Bounded recovery.** The agent retries a blocker through its recovery ladder (roughly five iterations or ~10 minutes) before escalating to a human instead of looping indefinitely.
- **Read-only log access by default.** Every built-in permission set grants the agent `roles/logging.viewer`, not admin — it cannot tamper with the audit-log sink. (The Terraform engine adds its roles as non-authoritative `google_project_iam_member` bindings, so a legacy `roles/logging.admin` grant made outside it is not removed automatically; audit and revoke such grants yourself.) Stronger environments should route an immutable log copy to a separate security project (see [User attribution](/kube-agents/reference/attribution/#trust-boundary)).
- **`AgentPlugin` create/update is an administrative privilege.** Treat the permission to create an `AgentPlugin` as equivalent to running code inside the agent pod, because that is what it does. The plugin's OCI image is mounted into the agent container and Hermes imports it, so the plugin executes with the agent's ServiceAccount, its Workload Identity binding, and its access to the credential proxy. The controls below constrain what a plugin can declare _in the CR_; none of them sandbox the plugin code itself. Restrict `agentplugins` RBAC to the same set of principals you would trust to change the agent's container image.

  The controls that do apply, and their exact scope:
  - **Opt-in `agentRef` targeting.** A plugin must set `spec.agentRef` to a `PlatformAgent.metadata.name` in its own namespace. Plugins whose `agentRef` does not match are ignored — a plugin cannot attach itself to every agent by omitting the field.
  - **`spec.targetProfile` chooses which agent's toolset the plugin sits beside.** It does not widen the trust boundary — plugin code already runs in the agent pod with its ServiceAccount, whichever profile loads it — but it does decide the company it keeps. A plugin left on the default profile loads into the Planning Agent, which is deliberately stripped of terminal, file, and code-execution tools. Targeting `platform` loads it into the Platform Agent instead, alongside `gcloud`, `kubectl`, and the GitOps write path, and makes its skills resolvable to the agent that holds them. Review a plugin that targets a privileged profile with that in mind, and note that `spec.config` cannot reach the `agent` subtree from either place, so a plugin still cannot raise its own retry or iteration budget.
  - **Name restriction.** `metadata.name` must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$` (max 56 characters), enforced by a CEL rule on the CRD. The name becomes both the mount directory and the module identifier Hermes imports.
  - **Config subtree allowlisting.** Only the top-level keys `approvals`, `platforms`, and `platform_toolsets` are merged from `spec.config`; every other key is dropped and logged. This keeps a plugin out of `agent` (including `agent.disabled_toolsets`), `leader_election`, `logging`, and `plugins`. It does **not** make the merge safe in general — see the two caveats below.
  - **Caveat: allowlisted subtrees still carry security weight.** `approvals` governs approval gating and `platform_toolsets` gates which toolsets a platform surface exposes. A plugin may set values under both. Allowlisting bounds _where_ a plugin can write, not _how much authority_ it can grant itself.
  - **Caveat: list merges are additive.** When a plugin supplies a list under an allowlisted key, its entries are unioned into the operator's list rather than replacing it. A plugin can therefore add a toolset to `platform_toolsets` but cannot remove one the operator configured.
  - **`spec.env` overrides operator-set variables.** Plugin-supplied environment variables take precedence over variables of the same name set by the operator, and secret references resolve against any Secret in the agent's namespace. Four names are exceptions: the operator appends `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_URL`, `AGENT_SHARED_STATE_SETUP`, `PATH`, and `PYTHONPATH` _after_ the merge, so a plugin's copy of any of them loses. The first keeps a plugin from redirecting the credential proxy; the second keeps it from switching off the container-startup setup that populates `$HERMES_HOME` (see [Container entrypoint](/kube-agents/deploy/docker-images/#container-entrypoint)), which would surface as plugins mounted but never enabled, far from the plugin that caused it. Secrets referenced this way land in the agent container's environment: this is a supported way to supply a plugin its own API token, not a preservation of the credential-proxy boundary, which only covers the credentials the proxy itself brokers. See [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/).

## Secrets Encryption & Local State Security

### GKE etcd Database Encryption (CMEK)

The install enforces Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for GKE database encryption:

- **Automated Cloud KMS Setup**: On a cluster the install creates, the [`gke-cluster` module](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/terraform/modules/gke-cluster)'s `enable_database_encryption` (default `true`) creates a dedicated Cloud KMS keyring and crypto key, grants the GKE service agent `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter`, and creates the cluster encrypted.
- **Existing clusters**: Terraform cannot mutate a cluster it did not create, so `./install.sh` runs a `gcloud` pre-step before the apply: it ensures the keyring, key, and service-agent binding exist and updates the live cluster's database encryption. Clusters that are already encrypted are left alone.
- **`ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_SECRETS` Override**: When installing onto an existing cluster or local test environment where CMEK must stay off, export `ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_SECRETS=true` to skip that pre-step.

### Local State Security (`vars.sh`)

Local configuration and state saved during installer execution (`k8s-operator/scripts/vars.sh`) are hardened as follows:

- **File Permissions**: State files are created with strict POSIX permissions (`umask 077` and `chmod 600`), preventing non-owner access. The `terraform.tfvars` the installer generates from `vars.sh` gets the same `0600` treatment, and is regenerated on every run so the two cannot disagree.
- **`PERSIST_SECRETS_ON_DISK`**: By default (`PERSIST_SECRETS_ON_DISK=true`), credentials entered during installation are stored in `vars.sh` for non-interactive re-runs. Set `PERSIST_SECRETS_ON_DISK=false` to prevent writing sensitive credentials to disk.
- **Secrets also live in Terraform state.** Every credential passed through the composition is stored in plaintext in the Terraform state, which the installer keeps in a GCS bucket (`<project>-kube-agents-tfstate`, versioned). Restrict that bucket's IAM to the administrators who may read the credentials; see the [composition README](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/tree/main/terraform/examples/full-install)'s warning.
