Everything kube-agents installs into a cluster carries the
[Kubernetes recommended labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/),
so the project's whole footprint is selectable in one query:

```bash
kubectl get all,configmap,pvc,serviceaccount,secret -A \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kube-agents
```

## The label contract

Every install path sets `name`, `instance`, `part-of`, and `managed-by`:

| Source                                                  | `name`                                              | `instance`                    | `part-of`     | `managed-by`               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| PlatformAgent controller output (per CR)                | `platform-agent`                                    | `<namespace>-<agent name>`    | `kube-agents` | `platformagent-controller` |
| Operator install (`k8s-operator/config/`)               | `kube-agents-operator`                              | `kube-agents-operator`        | `kube-agents` | `kustomize`                |
| Helm chart (`charts/kube-agents/`)                      | `kube-agents`, `kube-agents-operator`, or `litellm` | `<release name>`              | `kube-agents` | `Helm`                     |
| LiteLLM integration                                     | `litellm`                                           | `litellm`                     | `kube-agents` | `kustomize`                |
| GitHub token minter                                     | `github-token-minter`                               | `github-token-minter`         | `kube-agents` | `kustomize`                |
| Inference replay                                        | `inference-replay`                                  | `inference-replay`            | `kube-agents` | `kustomize`                |
| Hindsight memory store                                  | `hindsight`                                         | `hindsight`                   | `kube-agents` | `kustomize`                |
| Provisioned Secrets (`provision_07_gcp_k8s_secrets.sh`) | `platform-agent`                                    | `${NAMESPACE}-platform-agent` | `kube-agents` | `provisioner`              |

`component` is set by one source only, Hindsight, and everywhere else by nothing: the object's own
`name` already says what it is, and a second key that has to stay consistent with the first is a key
that eventually disagrees with it. Hindsight is the exception because it is one integration with two
unrelated workloads — an API server and its Postgres database — so `name` alone cannot tell them
apart. Its objects carry `app.kubernetes.io/component: api` or `postgresql`, and those values are
load-bearing rather than decorative: the Deployment and StatefulSet selectors, the `NetworkPolicy`
that lets only the API reach port 5432, and the `PodMonitoring` that must scrape the API and not the
database are all built from them. Do not add `component` anywhere else on the strength of this.

`version` is set only by the Helm chart, which fills it from `Chart.AppVersion` — a chart release
is pinned to exactly one application release, so there is a correct value to write. See
[Release versioning](/kube-agents/deploy/release-versioning/). No other path sets it. The
controller writes objects whose version is whatever image the CR asked for, and an image reference
may carry a digest, whose `@` and `:` are not legal in a label value; the kustomizations and the
provisioner have no build identity to report at all. A `version` label that is present on some of
the footprint and absent from the rest is worse than one that is consistently absent, so select on
image references, not on this label, when you need to know what is actually running.

`instance` carries the namespace for controller-created objects because the controller also
writes cluster-scoped ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings, where a bare CR name is ambiguous
between two agents of the same name in different namespaces. Nothing bounds a PlatformAgent name
to a length that fits a label value, so the joined value is truncated to 63 characters. The
singleton installs use `instance == name`; there is only one per cluster.

`managed-by` names the thing that writes the object, so you can tell an object the operator
reconciles from one a human applied with `kustomize` or the provisioner created.

## What is not labelled

Objects the Platform Agent authors at runtime through its skills are user workloads, not project
infrastructure, and do not get these labels. Those carry the
`kubeagents.x-k8s.io/requested-by` annotation instead — see
[User attribution](/kube-agents/reference/attribution/) for why per-requester identity belongs in
an annotation rather than a label.

CRDs installed by the Helm chart are also unlabelled. Helm applies everything in a chart's `crds/`
directory verbatim and never renders it as a template, and those files are byte-for-byte copies of
`k8s-operator/config/crd/bases/` enforced by `make chart-check`, so there is nowhere to put the
labels. Installing the CRDs through `k8s-operator/config/crd/` instead does label them — that
kustomization sets the four keys itself.

## Upgrade notes

Three constraints shape how the labels are applied, and all three matter when upgrading an existing
install:

- **Selectors are never touched.** Deployment and StatefulSet `spec.selector` is immutable, so
  adding a label there would make the API server reject the update on every existing install.
  The controller keeps `app: <name>-gateway` as the sole selector key, and every kustomization
  sets `includeSelectors: false`. Do not "tidy" this by adding the recommended labels to a
  selector.
- **Pod templates do get the labels**, which changes the pod template hash and therefore causes
  **one rollout** of the agent Deployment the first time you upgrade to a version that includes
  them. This is expected and happens once. The same applies to an existing Hindsight install, where
  it restarts both the API and the Postgres pod — the database lives on
  `data-hindsight-postgresql-0`, which the restart does not touch, so no memories are lost, but
  memory is briefly unavailable while Postgres and the API's models reload.
- **`volumeClaimTemplates` are never touched either**, and this one is a trap rather than a choice.
  Kustomize's `includeTemplates: true` does not label only pod templates: on a StatefulSet it also
  labels `spec.volumeClaimTemplates[].metadata`, which is among the fields the API server refuses
  to update after creation. The object is then rejected whole, with
  `updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas' ... are forbidden`. A fresh install
  accepts it and only upgrades break, so it is invisible until someone has one. The Hindsight
  kustomization — the only one here with a StatefulSet — therefore sets `includeTemplates: false`
  and patches the two pod templates directly instead.

PersistentVolumeClaims are created once and never updated by the controller, so claims that
existed before the upgrade stay unlabelled until they are recreated. They will not appear in the
`-l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kube-agents` query above. The constraint above means Hindsight's
claim stays unlabelled permanently, not just until recreation.

## Query recipes

Everything one PlatformAgent owns, including its cluster-scoped RBAC:

```bash
AGENT_INSTANCE=kubeagents-system-platform-agent
kubectl get all,configmap,pvc,serviceaccount,secret -A -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=$AGENT_INSTANCE"
kubectl get clusterrole,clusterrolebinding -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=$AGENT_INSTANCE"
```

Only what the operator reconciles, excluding anything applied by hand:

```bash
kubectl get all -A -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=platformagent-controller
```

Just the integrations:

```bash
kubectl get all -A \
  -l 'app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kube-agents,app.kubernetes.io/name in (litellm,github-token-minter,inference-replay,hindsight)'
```

Cluster-scoped RBAC the project owns — the objects most easily orphaned, since a namespaced
PlatformAgent cannot own a cluster-scoped resource through an owner reference:

```bash
kubectl get clusterrole,clusterrolebinding -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kube-agents
```

## Where to go next

- [User attribution](/kube-agents/reference/attribution/) — annotations that connect an object to
  the human who asked for it.
- [Security & IAM](/kube-agents/reference/security-and-iam/) — what the agent is and is not
  permitted to do.
