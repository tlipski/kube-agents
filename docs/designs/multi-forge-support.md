# Supporting a Second Forge

> **STATUS — design of record; not implemented.** Nothing below ships today. One provider exists

**Scope:** What it would take for a kube-agents install to drive a forge that is not GitHub, and how
to get there without a flag day. GitLab is the worked example throughout because it is the one asked
for; nothing here is specific to it.
**Owns:** the repository-identity model, the provider contract as it grows past its first feature,
the per-provider token and git-credential shapes, the declarative surface and the vocabulary the
prompts use, where MCP fits, and the sequencing of all of it. The provider protocol's original
seven operations and the reasoning behind their normalisations belong to
[`pr-comment-conversation.md`](pr-comment-conversation.md) §3; credential containment belongs to
[`../credential-isolation-design.md`](../credential-isolation-design.md).

---

## 1. The problem

The Platform Agent opens pull requests, resolves issues, publishes audit ledgers and answers review
comments. All of it goes to GitHub, and most of it says so in code. An install whose GitOps
repository lives on GitLab cannot use any of it.

The coupling runs through five layers, each with a different owner and a different cost to unwind:

1. **The consumers.** Five scripts call the forge's API to get work done. Two go through a provider
   abstraction; three shell `gh` directly, two behind a private runner of their own and one inline.
   (`github_token_refresh.py` and `credential_proxy.py` also run `gh`, but for credentials rather
   than for forge work; they are layer 3.)
2. **Repository identity.** `owner/repo` — exactly two path segments — is asserted in seven places
   across Python and Go, and one regex expressing it is copy-pasted into six modules. This is the
   widest assumption and the one least visible from any single file.
3. **The credential plane.** The sandbox may hold no token, so every forge call is brokered. The
   broker's executable allowlist, its refresh route, the git credential shape it writes, and the
   token-minting pipeline behind it are each written for GitHub specifically — as is the FQDN
   network policy that decides where the pod may reach at all.
4. **The declarative surface.** `GitHubSpec` is the only forge integration in the CRD, its `org`
   field takes GitHub's namespace grammar, the state ConfigMap the operator writes labels every
   repository `github` by a constant, and the chart, installer and Terraform composition all carry
   GitHub App inputs.
5. **The prompts.** Four `SKILL.md` files instruct the model in `gh` spellings; seven governance
   SOPs name `gh` to forbid it and call the artefact a pull request throughout.

Layers 1, 2 and 3 are worth changing whether or not a second forge ever arrives — each one removes a
duplicated parser, a silent fallback, or a hardcoded host. Layer 5 is only worth changing for a
second forge, and layer 4 almost is: its one standalone defect is that the CR silently rewrites one
shape of non-GitHub URL into a GitHub one (§3), which is worth fixing on its own but does not need
any of this. That split says what is worth doing; it does not decide the order, which §9 derives
from three sequencing constraints instead — and one of those pulls part of layer 4 forward ahead of
layers 1 and 3.

## 2. What already generalises

Two things exist and do not need designing again.

**The provider protocol.** `agents/platform/scripts/forge.py` defines `ForgeProvider` as seven
operations, normalises three GitHub-isms behind them (`can_write` as a boolean rather than
`author_association`, `supports_acknowledge` as a capability rather than an assumption,
`normalise_login` folding the spellings one account gets), and funnels every provider call through
one `_call()` override point. `pr-comment-conversation.md` §3 explains each of those and why live
validation forced two of them; this document does not restate it.

**Provider selection.** `PROVIDERS` is a host-keyed table and `provider_for` reads it. Adding a
forge is a registration rather than a branch in a sweep.

A third is half-built, and the missing half is the one this design turns on. **A place to record
which forge a repository belongs to now exists.** The `managed_repos` state ConfigMap carries a list
of `{"type", "url"}` entries — `ManagedRepoEntry` in Go, `get_managed_repo_entries()` in Python — so
the discriminator is already per repository rather than per install, and already crosses the
operator-to-agent boundary.

Nothing dispatches on it, and the gap is already costing something. The operator only ever authors
`{Type: "github", URL: …}`, but it does not confine the field to that: `parseManagedRepoEntries`
unmarshals whatever type string the ConfigMap holds, the merge writes existing entries back
verbatim, and `GitHubSpec.GitRepo`'s own comment invites a cluster administrator to register
repositories in that ConfigMap directly. A `{"type": "gitlab", …}` entry therefore survives
reconciliation intact and reaches the agent — where `get_managed_github_repos()` keeps the `github`
entries, drops the rest without a word, and returns bare slugs. A repository an administrator
registered disappears at the one point where the forge could have chosen a provider from it. The
`pr_comments` sweep then calls `forge.provider_for()` with no argument at all, having just
discovered its repositories through that function, so it gets `GitHubProvider` from the default
rather than from the data.

`provider_for` does take a repository now, and `pr-conversation` passes one, but it infers the forge
from the string rather than reading it from the entry — §3 covers how. The discriminator has to be
dispatched on rather than filtered by, so that a host the table does not know is a rejection rather
than a silent drop.

## 3. Repository identity

`owner/repo` is asserted in seven places, across five modules and two languages, and no module can
see what another is asserting:

- `forge._parse_repo` matches a `github.com` URL or a bare one-slash slug, and raises
  `RepoUnparseable` otherwise.
- `gitops_workspace.is_valid_repo_slug` matches the same one-slash shape and returns a boolean, with
  `_valid_repo_component` separately rejecting `..` and a leading dash in either half.
- `gitops_workspace.extract_github_slug` strips one of four literal GitHub prefixes and returns
  `None` for anything else that looks like a URL or an SCP endpoint.
- `github_token_refresh.github_repo_from_remote` returns `owner/repo` from a git remote, and returns
  `None` for a host that is not GitHub.
- `github_token_refresh.refresh_git_credentials` asserts it inline — `repository.count("/") != 1`
  raises — on the path every token refresh takes, sidecar or direct.
- `credential_proxy.is_valid_repository` splits on the first `/` and requires the remainder to hold
  no further separator, so a deeper path fails validation.
- `CleanRepoSlugWithOrg` in the operator strips the scheme, a `user@` prefix, an SCP `host:` prefix
  and a `github.com/` prefix, then requires exactly one slash in what is left.
  `ValidateGitRepoURLWithOrg` — the CRD's admission check — is a call to it, so admission and
  normalisation are one rule.

The regex behind the bare-slug form is additionally copy-pasted under its own name into six Python
modules: `forge.py`, `gitops_workspace.py`, `resolver.py`, `pr_conversation.py`, `audit_report.py`
and `submit_suggestion.py`. Two of those six copies are already dead — defined and never referenced
again — which is what unmanaged duplication looks like before anyone tries to change the shape.

GitLab projects live at arbitrary depth — `group/subgroup/project` is ordinary, not exotic — and none
of the seven handles one. All of them refuse it, in four dialects: two raise (a reason-coded
`RepoUnparseable`, and a bare `RuntimeError`), two return `None`, two return `False`, and one
returns a Go `error`.

**The one non-GitHub input that is not refused.** `CleanRepoSlugWithOrg` counts slashes _after_
discarding the host, so an SCP-style URL whose path holds exactly one slash survives — and that is
the form GitLab's clone button hands you for a project sitting directly under its group.
`git@gitlab.com:group/project` is admitted by the CRD, reduced to `group/project`, and then
`CleanRepoURLWithOrg`, which prefixes a literal `https://github.com/` to any shorthand, writes it
into the state ConfigMap as `{"type": "github", "url": "https://github.com/group/project"}`. The
GitLab repository is not rejected; it is rewritten into a GitHub one and labelled `github` by the
constant §2 describes. Every reader downstream then behaves correctly, on a repository the operator
invented. This is the layer-4 defect §1 says is worth fixing on its own.

**The change.** One `RepoRef` carrying a host and an opaque, arbitrary-depth path, constructed in one
place and passed rather than re-parsed. Every validator above becomes a caller. The two-segment rule
survives as a per-provider validation on the GitHub provider, where it is true, instead of as an
invariant of the whole stack, where it is not — and the host survives the parse instead of being
discarded before the slashes are counted.

`forge.py`'s "On the repository parser" note describes code that no longer exists: a parity test
holding `_parse_repo` level with `resolver.get_target_repo`, and `gitops_workspace.repo_from_settings`
as a loose parser knowingly left unfixed. All three are gone, and `resolver.py` imports
`gitops_workspace` now instead of carrying a parser of its own. Correcting that note belongs to
step 1, which is what makes it true again.

**Where #1085 now stands.** [#1085](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/issues/1085) reported
that `repo_from_settings` resolved `https://evil.example/victim-org/victim-repo` to
`victim-org/victim-repo` with no host check, pointing the token refresher at a repository the URL did
not name. That function is gone. Three of the issue's four examples are now rejected at admission by
the slash count above, and the fourth — the SCP form — is admitted with its host silently discarded,
which grants nothing the plain `owner/repo` shorthand does not already grant. The host confusion the
issue reported is closed; what the same code path costs now is the rewrite in the paragraph above.
What remains is the half the issue deferred — "decide separately whether `ValidateGitRepoURL` should
reject a non-GitHub host at admission". It does not, which is §6, so the remedy is step 2 rather
than `RepoRef`.

**A latent defect this also removes.** `provider_for` has two ways of choosing wrong. It selects by
asking whether any key of the host table appears anywhere in the repository string — a substring
test rather than a parsed host, so `https://example.invalid/github.com/o/r` would select
`GitHubProvider` — and it falls back to `GitHubProvider` for anything it does not match. Neither
picks the wrong provider today, because no caller hands it a host: the sweep passes nothing at all,
and both of `pr-conversation`'s sources yield bare `owner/repo` slugs — `extract_github_slug` for
the discovered ones, `is_valid_repo_slug` for `--repo`. The fallback is the only branch taken: every
provider in the running system comes from it, and the host table is reached only from tests.

That is sound while there is one provider and a bare slug means GitHub, which is what the docstring
says. It stops being sound at the second, because the table becomes load-bearing at exactly the
moment a caller starts passing hosts — and §4 is about to add three callers that resolve
repositories their own way. Selection must parse the host, and an unknown one must raise with a
reason code, the way every other unresolvable input in this stack does.

## 4. The provider contract past its first feature

`forge.py` serves two consumers — the `pr_comments` sweep in `github_scan_gate.py` and the
`pr-conversation` worker skill — and both are the same feature seen from its two ends. Everything
else is outside it: `resolver.py` and `audit_report.py` each carry a private `gh` runner of their
own, and `submit_suggestion.py` does not even have that, shelling `["gh", …]` inline at three call
sites. A second forge implemented against `forge.py` alone therefore buys a reviewer conversation
and no issue resolution, no audit ledger, and no way to open a change.

Migrating those three onto the provider is the step that makes a forge a class rather than four
rewrites. It is anticipated rather than planned:
[`pr-comment-conversation.md`](pr-comment-conversation.md) §7 names `resolver.py` as the module's
obvious next consumer while holding the migration itself out of scope. Half of that has since
happened by another route — `resolver.py` dropped its own repository parser and imports
`gitops_workspace` for one instead — but it still runs its own `gh`, which is the half this section
is about. This design puts the rest on a schedule, and §9 says why that schedule puts it before any
GitLab code.

The protocol grows to the union of what the four need. Beyond the existing seven, that is opening a
change (branch plus pull request), editing and reading one back, listing and commenting on issues,
and setting labels. The precise list falls out of the migration rather than being guessed here; what
matters to this design is that it is decided by the callers, not by GitHub's API surface, and that
harness policy stays above the provider. The existing split is the precedent: the provider answers
"what is open" and the caller answers "which of those are mine", so the branch-prefix and
`agent:ignore` rules are written once instead of once per forge.

Two provider shapes come out of the credential plane rather than out of this section, and §5 explains
why: a CLI-backed provider that shells a brokered binary, and a proxy-backed provider that speaks
REST through a sidecar route. Both implement the same protocol; `_call()` is where they differ.

## 5. The credential plane

The governing constraint is [`../credential-isolation-design.md`](../credential-isolation-design.md):
the agent sandbox receives no API keys or access tokens through its environment or filesystem (the
ServiceAccount token is covered too under `spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod`). Every forge
call is therefore brokered by the credential sidecar, and a second forge is a change to the broker
before it is a change to the agent.

Five things name GitHub: three inside the broker, the minting pipeline behind it, and the network
policy that lets the pod out at all.

**The executable allowlist.** `ALLOWED_EXECUTABLES` is `("gcloud", "kubectl", "gh", "git")`, a class
attribute of `CommandExecutor` read from three places — and `credential_proxy_client.py` carries the
same set again as `SUPPORTED_EXECUTABLES`, so the step is two files, not one. GitLab has `glab`, so
a GitLab install wants that entry and a GitHub install must not have it — an allowlist that is the
union of every supported
forge grants every install more than it uses. The allowlist becomes install-configuration derived
from the configured providers rather than a constant, which is a change to how the executor is
constructed and not a one-line edit to a tuple.

Not every forge has a CLI. Bitbucket Cloud has none, which is why `forge.py` was built with the
`_call()` seam in the first place: a provider with no binary to shell needs a `/v1/<forge>/…` route
on the sidecar and reaches it through that one method. Both shapes are supported and neither is
preferred; the choice is a property of the forge.

**The refresh route.** `/v1/github/refresh` is a path, not a parameter. It becomes
`/v1/forge/refresh` with the provider in the body, and the old path stays as an alias so an agent
image and a sidecar image can differ by one release without the refresher breaking.

**Git credentials.** `refresh_git_credentials` writes no credential line of its own. It runs
`gh auth login --with-token` and then `gh auth setup-git`, which installs the GitHub CLI itself as
git's credential helper — `credential.helper = !gh auth git-credential`. The forge coupling here is
therefore not a username or a URL template that a provider could supply; it is that the helper is a
forge's CLI. `glab` has an equivalent and would work the same way, but a forge with no CLI has no
binary to install as a helper at all, so the sidecar has to serve one. That is the same split as the
paragraph above: a CLI-backed provider configures a helper, a proxy-backed provider needs one
written for it.

**Token acquisition, which is where the two forges genuinely diverge.** GitHub App installation
tokens must be minted from a JWT signed by the App's private key and expire hourly, so the install
runs Minty — the workload in `charts/kube-agents/templates/github-minter.yaml`, with the KMS key and
service accounts behind it provisioned by `terraform/modules/github-minter`. That apparatus follows
from App tokens being short-lived and signature-derived. A GitLab group or project access token is a
long-lived string with no minting step at all, so the broker's job for GitLab is storage and scoping
rather than signing, and the KMS key, the signing service and the `github-token-minter-config`
policy ConfigMap have no analogue to build.

That asymmetry decides the shape: token acquisition is a **strategy selected per provider**, not a
pipeline every forge is fitted into. GitHub keeps Minty. GitLab starts with a group access token in a
Secret mounted **into the credential sidecar** — never into the agent sandbox, which is what the
first paragraph of this section forbids — which is the smallest thing that works and the one an
operator can rotate without new infrastructure. OIDC token exchange is the better long-run answer
for GitLab and is deliberately deferred: it is a second design, and the first working install does
not need it.

**Egress.** `github.com`, `*.github.com` and `*.githubusercontent.com` are literals in the FQDN
network policy, written twice: the operator renders them in
`k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go`, which is what a real install gets,
and `deploy/kustomize/gke-dataplane-v2/fqdn-networkpolicy.yaml` carries the same three for the dev
path. Both derive from the configured forge hosts instead — changing only the kustomize copy leaves
every shipped install unchanged. A self-managed GitLab is at a customer-chosen hostname, so no
literal could have covered it.

## 6. The declarative surface

`IntegrationSpec` holds exactly one forge field, `GitHub *GitHubSpec`, and `GitHubSpec` holds two:
`GitRepo` and `Org`. (`PlatformAgentIntegrationSpec` embeds it alongside `GoogleChat` and `Slack`, so
GitHub is the only _forge_ integration rather than the only integration.) `Org` carries GitHub's
namespace grammar in a CRD pattern — alphanumerics and hyphens, at most 39 characters — which is not
GitLab's: a group path admits dots and underscores, and a project can sit several groups deep, so no
value of `org` names a nested GitLab namespace. `GitRepo`'s validation, `ValidateGitRepoURLWithOrg`,
checks length and non-graphic runes and then defers to `CleanRepoSlugWithOrg`, so what the CR
enforces about the repository is "exactly one slash once the host has been discarded" — and nothing
at all about the host. The declarative surface names GitHub in the field path and nowhere in the
validation, and the check that does fire is a shape check standing in for the host check §3 shows is
the one that matters.

The operator then writes the repository into the `managed_repos` state ConfigMap as a
`ManagedRepoEntry` whose `type` is the literal `"github"`. §2 covers what the agent does with that;
what belongs here is that the discriminator this design needs already has a field, a schema and a
transport, and that the only thing missing at this layer is a way to declare it — which is why an
administrator who writes one straight into the ConfigMap gets an entry the operator preserves and
the agent discards.

The change is `spec.integration.git` carrying a provider, a host and a repository, with
`spec.integration.github` kept as a deprecated alias that maps onto it. Validation becomes
provider-dispatched — each provider asserting its own namespace grammar, and each rejecting a host
that is not its own — rather than one host-blind shape check standing in for all of them.
`ManagedRepoEntry.Type` stops being a constant and carries the declared provider, which is how the
discriminator reaches the agent: written down by the operator, rather than inferred from the URL's
text.

`install.sh` and `terraform/examples/full-install` carry the GitHub App inputs as
`github_app_id`, `enable_github_minter` and `github_minter_kms_*`; the chart spells the same
settings `githubMinter.appId`, `githubMinter.enabled` and `githubMinter.kms.*`. All of them become
provider-conditional: an install that declares GitLab provisions no KMS key and no minter.

## 7. Vocabulary

Two kinds of prompt name the forge, and they need different work.

Four `SKILL.md` files instruct the model in `gh` spellings and call the artefact a pull request:
`fleet-audit`, `pr-conversation` and `submit-suggestion` under `agents/platform/skills/`, and
`gke-stockout-investigator` under `agentplugins/`, which reaches an install through the
`AgentPlugin` CRD rather than through the agent image and so is easy to miss. These want the command
behind a wrapper and the noun taken from configuration.

The seven governance SOPs name `gh` only to forbid it — "never run `gh issue create`", "the helper
owns every `git`/`gh` operation" — because `audit_report.py` owns their write path. A prohibition has
no command to wrap, so the SOP work is smaller and different: the nouns ("pull request", "PR body")
come from configuration, and the prohibitions get reworded once the helper they defer to is a
provider rather than `gh`. §4 moves that helper; this step only follows it.

`github-issue-resolver`, the skill a reader would expect on the first list, is not on it: its prompt
names no forge command — only its own `resolver.py` subcommands — and its coupling is entirely in
that script, which §4 also moves.

`pr-comment-conversation.md` §6 already prescribes this for the worker skill, which is told to take
`forge` and `noun` from the card "so one prompt serves a forge whose users call them merge requests".
This design extends the same rule to the SOPs rather than inventing a second convention.

## 8. Why an MCP server is an addition, not the mechanism

A GitLab MCP server is a reasonable thing to want, and it cannot carry this design. Two reasons, and
they are independent.

**Half the forge work has no model in the loop.** `github_scan_gate.py` is a `no_agent` cron script
by deliberate design: an idle tick costs a handful of `gh` calls, no model turn and no tokens, which
is the whole reason the earlier prompt-driven poller was retired. MCP is a model-facing tool
surface, so it cannot serve that sweep, and it cannot serve the audit publish path or the
guardrails in
`submit_suggestion.py` either. Those need an importable library whatever else exists.

**An MCP server in the sandbox would hold a token.** MCP servers are spawned as child processes of
the agent container. A `GITLAB_TOKEN` in that process's environment is precisely what
`credential-isolation-design.md` guarantees against. The two remote MCP servers that ship today are
not a counterexample: they authenticate with a forked `mcp-remote` that mints Google ADC tokens per
call, and ADC is ambient to the pod rather than injected as a secret. A forge PAT has no ambient
equivalent.

The second is answered by running the MCP server as a trusted sidecar beside the credential proxy,
with the agent reaching it over loopback and the sidecar attaching the token — the same containment
the `_call()` seam already provides for a proxy-backed provider, expressed at the MCP layer instead
of the REST one. The first has no such answer, because no arrangement of MCP servers puts a model in
a cron loop that deliberately has none. The library stays either way.

Where it pays off is the interactive path — an agent asked in chat to read a merge request, or a
worker turn answering a review comment. There, typed MCP tools are better than teaching a model
`glab` spellings in SOP prose. So the provider is the mechanism and MCP is an optional surface on top
of it, added last and depended on by nothing.

## 9. Implementation order

The order is not preference. Three constraints fix most of it.

**Reader before writer.** The provider discriminator §2 calls for crosses a process boundary: the Go
operator declares it, the Python agent acts on it. Widening what the writer may emit before the
reader accepts it produces a release where a valid CR is rejected inside the pod, and the operator
sees a reconcile that succeeded and an agent that will not start. Repository identity therefore
lands in Python first and in Go second — and the reader here is not only the parser. It is
`get_managed_github_repos()`, which drops every entry whose `type` is not `github`. Teaching the
operator to emit `type: gitlab` while that filter still runs is exactly the failure this constraint
describes: a reconcile that succeeds and a repository the agent never sees. Turning that filter into
a dispatch therefore lands in step 1, with the parsing work, and not in step 2 with the field that
feeds it.

That pairing is also why the Go half of layer 4 runs ahead of layers 1 and 3, which §1 ranks as the
work worth doing regardless. Both of those dispatch on the provider — the consumer migration decides
which provider a caller gets, the credential plane decides which token and which binary — so the
discriminator has to be declared before either has anything to dispatch on. Sequencing it later
means building both against the inference §2 describes and then rewriting them.

**No-behaviour-change before behaviour change.** The consumer migration (§4) is a large diff with no
functional delta, verifiable against the GitHub install that already exists. Landing it before any
GitLab code means a reviewer reads one thing at a time, and a regression has one candidate cause.

**Everything provable on GitHub, before anything that needs GitLab.** Steps 1 to 4 can each be
exercised against the running GitHub install by showing the existing behaviour unchanged — including
the CRD step, where the evidence is a GitHub CR still admitting and reconciling through the new
`spec.integration.git` shape and its alias. The first change that cannot is the `GitLabProvider`
itself, which needs a real GitLab project to validate against. That
environment does not exist here today — see §10 — so the design puts every step that does not need it
first, and none of that work is stranded if the environment question takes a while to answer.

The resulting sequence:

1. **Repository identity** (§3): `RepoRef` in Python, with the host parsed and carried rather than
   discarded and unknown hosts raising. The Python assertions become callers, the duplicated regex
   goes, `get_managed_github_repos()` becomes a dispatch on `type` rather than a filter by it, and
   `forge.py`'s parser note is corrected to the arrangement that results.
2. **The declarative surface, Go half** (§6): `spec.integration.git`, the deprecated alias,
   provider-dispatched validation, and `ManagedRepoEntry.Type` carrying the declared provider for
   the agent to read. §3's SCP rewrite is fixed here and #1085 closes here, because this step is
   already rewriting that admission path — either could land ahead of the sequence instead.
3. **The consumer migration** (§4): protocol widened, the three remaining scripts moved onto it.
   Splits naturally by consumer.
4. **The credential plane** (§5): route, executable allowlist and egress allowlist parameterised,
   and the git credential helper selected per provider — for a CLI-backed forge that is its own
   `setup-git` equivalent, for a proxy-backed one a helper the sidecar serves. Still one provider.
5. **`GitLabProvider`** (§4, §5): the first new forge, with a Secret-backed token.
6. **Vocabulary** (§7): the four skills, then the SOPs' nouns and prohibitions.
7. **MCP sidecar** (§8), if wanted. Depended on by nothing above.

## 10. Open questions

- **Where a GitLab install gets validated.** No environment here has a GitLab, and step 5 cannot fill
  in a Live validation section without one — nor can steps 6 and 7 be shown doing what they are for,
  though both can at least be shown not to regress GitHub. The choice is a gitlab.com project with
  a group access token, or a self-managed GitLab in the development cluster. Self-managed also
  exercises the
  customer-chosen-hostname path that no literal egress rule could cover, which argues for it, at the
  cost of standing infrastructure.
- **Whether gitlab.com and self-managed GitLab are one provider or two.**
  `pr-comment-conversation.md` §3 records that "Bitbucket" is two providers sharing almost nothing.
  GitLab is better off than that — the API is the same — but the token model, the host and the
  network path all differ, and a single class that branches on "is this gitlab.com" is how the
  Bitbucket mistake would be repeated in a smaller way.
- **Whether one field can name the token's scope boundary on both forges** (§6). On GitHub that
  boundary is an App installation and it lines up with the first path component. On GitLab it is a
  group, a project's namespace can sit several segments below it, and "the first path component" is
  therefore false. Either the field generalises to "scope boundary" and each provider says how to
  derive it, or the two forges want different fields. The token-scoping code depends on the answer,
  and so does whether a per-repository permission policy has anywhere to hang.
- **Whether the Minty policy ConfigMap has an analogue.** GitHub's per-repository permission policy
  is enforced at mint time. A long-lived GitLab token carries its scope from creation, so the
  equivalent enforcement — if it is wanted — has to live somewhere else, most plausibly as a check in
  the broker before it brokers.
