# Chatops gateway design

- **Author:** [@bnaylor]
- **Date:** 2026-08-24
- **Status:** draft for review

## Purpose

This document defines the chatops gateway: the component that connects chat backends to
the A2A bus. It covers what a user session is, how sessions are spawned and reaped, how
requester identity gets onto the bus, what we do about group chats, and which chat backend
we stand up first for testing.

The demo gateway was single-user and trusting - one hardcoded "chatops" session, identity
asserted in an envelope field nothing verifies, no concept of a room. This doc is the
design for the real one.

Companion docs: the payload spec owns the envelope and the task lifecycle, and reserves
the `identity` and `authority` fields this doc names. The execution shape is settled -
pod per session, gateway coded to the headless CLI contract - and this design assumes
it. The NATS deployment spec owns accounts and connection-time authz.
The declarative subagent framework (its own doc) owns profile-addressed delegation -
the dispatcher, Jobs, `AgentProfile`s. This doc stops at the session boundary, with one
amendment (8/31): the Delegate flow below hands a single task to a fresh
gateway-spawned session worker, which stays inside the session model - the worker is an
incarnation of the conversation's own session, not a profile executor.

## The gateway holds no model

The demo gateway ran a Claude session of its own and used it to decide when to delegate.
That was fine for a demo and is wrong for the product. The gateway sees every human
message in the system, which makes it the component where a context window does the most
damage - anything in its context is influenceable by anyone who can type at it.

So the gateway is deterministic code: adapters, a session manager, a bus client. No
prompt, no tools, nothing to inject into. The judgment the demo gateway exercised moves
into the session pods, which is where the model already lives. The safety classifier
discussed for group chats slots in beside the gateway later as a veto - it can block or
reroute a message, and it never widens anything.

## What a session is

**A session is one backend conversation bound to one `contextId`, executed by at most one
pod at a time.** Concretely:

- The session key is the backend-qualified conversation id - a DM, or a thread in a
  group space (eg `discord:1234/5678`, `gchat:spaces/AAA/threads/BBB`). A channel or
  space is not a session; a conversation in it is.
- `contextId` is minted at first contact with a conversation and never changes. It is
  the durable name of the conversation on the bus. Minting MUST be create-only (a KV
  `Create`, compare-and-swap semantics), so that two replicas or a rehydrate racing
  first contact cannot fork a conversation - the loser reads and adopts the winner's
  value. The stage 1 gateway runs a single replica and serializes per conversation
  in-process, which narrows the race without closing it (a plain `Put` persists the
  record today); the `Create` is owed before a second replica is.
- The pod is an incarnation, not the identity. Reaping and respawning changes the pod
  and the bus session name; `contextId` persists across every incarnation.
- In a group thread, everyone in the room shares the one session. Attribution is per
  turn, in the envelope, not per pod.

This settles the payload spec's open `contextId` scope question: **per conversation
(thread or DM), not per pod and not per space.** Per-pod would break correlation across
a reap/resume cycle, which is the normal lifecycle, not an edge case. Per-space would
mix unrelated conversations into one context and make the room the unit of history,
which nobody wants from a busy channel.

Session state lives in a NATS KV bucket, keyed by session key: `contextId`, current pod
name, bus session name, last-activity timestamp, roster, the task history with each
task's own addressee (session addressees rotate per incarnation, so a straggler's
replay must use the addressee its subjects carried, not the record's current one), and
the active task's serialization record - `taskId`, `correlationId`, the echoed `ask`
(truncated) and its `submittedAt`, which feed the status card below; the `ask` copy is
user content, governed by the content rule in the identity section. Runtime state is
not git and not pod annotations; KV is the house answer. A gateway restart rediscovers its sessions
from KV plus pod labels, so a gateway crash strands nothing - the pods keep running and
the transcript is on the stream.

## Turns and tasks

One user turn is one A2A task. On each inbound chat message the gateway:

1. Verifies the sender against the backend's identity mechanism (below) and drops the
   message if it can't.
2. For a message that starts a task: mints a fresh `correlationId` - this is the
   originating user interaction the payload spec names, so minting happens here and
   nowhere else - plus a `taskId`. A follow-up or steer to a running task reuses that
   task's `taskId` and `correlationId`, and is attributed by its own envelope and
   `authority` block.
3. Publishes `kind: message` to `a2a.tasks.{session}.{taskId}.in` - the session is the
   addressee - with the conversation's `contextId` and the authority block below.
4. Subscribes to the task's events subject and relays status and artifact updates back
   into the conversation.

The backend-native message id is recorded against the `correlationId` in the gateway's
ingress log, so the audit chain runs chat message -> correlationId -> every hop -> change.

Tasks serialize per session. A message that arrives while a task is `input-required` is
the follow-up input for that task (same `taskId`, per the payload spec). **Decided 8/24,
reversing this doc's draft:** a message that arrives while a task is `working` is
_injected_ as steering - a follow-up `message` on the same `taskId`, forwarded to the
harness stdin, absorbed at its next turn boundary. That matches what `kanban_comment`
gives users today, the adapter owes the same stdin path to `input-required` anyway, and
each steer carries its own `authority` block, so group-room attribution stays clean. A
cancel affordance ("stop") maps to `kind: cancel` and stays the hard interrupt; wiring it
to a chat gesture is adapter polish, later.

**The deterministic interceptors (amended 8/31).** The gateway holds no model, so its
affordances are literal: a small set of normalized phrases and prefixes, deterministic
by construction. Three interceptors run on each turn, ahead of the routing above:

- **Status ask.** While a task is active, a message matching the status set ("status",
  "what is it doing", …) is answered by stream replay - a status card carrying the
  task's state, the echoed ask, an elapsed clock since submission, the transition
  history, and the latest `progress` line, labeled as replay so nobody reads it as a
  live claim about the executor. It never reaches the executor.
- **Stop.** "stop" / "cancel" / "abort", exact after normalization - the text form of
  the cancel affordance above; a backend-native gesture stays adapter polish, later.
  A stopped task whose terminal event has not yet arrived DETACHES: it stops
  serializing the conversation - new turns start new tasks - while its events, if
  they ever arrive, still relay. "Detached" and "non-detached" below mean exactly
  this state and its absence.
- **Delegate.** A prefix, not a phrase, and recognized only when no live task
  serializes the conversation; its own section below.

Two routes exist, and the terms recur below: a conversation is **fixed-routed** when
its tasks address the standing executor configured at deploy time (the platform front
door), and **session-routed** when they address the conversation's own spawned worker.
The two differ on steers: a session worker absorbs them at its next turn boundary,
while the standing front door refuses them with an honest status reply - the refusal
posture the payload spec's steering rule records.

The status matcher's width bias inverts per executor, and the inversion is the
contract, not a tuning detail. Beyond the exact phrase set there is a wide
interrogative rule (status-shaped words in an interrogative frame), and it applies only
where the executor refuses steers - the fixed-route front door - because there a stolen
false positive costs nothing. Where the executor absorbs steers, a session worker, only
the exact phrases match: a stolen steer there is a dropped correction, and a
status-shaped steer is a question the worker can answer itself. Anything no interceptor
claims during a `working` task is a steer, per the 8/24 decision above.

**Gateway-authored posts (amended 8/31).** Step 4's relay - events in, chat out - is
not the whole output story: the gateway authors a small set of posts of its own. The
placeholder that opens a task ("submitted…", which becomes the rolling line the relay
edits), the status card, the steer acknowledgement, and failure notices (a submission
or steer that never reached the bus). All are deterministic templates over facts the
gateway itself owns - its own publishes, its own registry, stream replay - which is
what keeps them inside the no-model rule. They also say only what the gateway knows:
the steer acknowledgement reports that the steer is on the stream, and what it says
next is conditioned on the route the same way the width bias above is, because the
gateway knows the route and the two executors do different things: on a
session-routed conversation, that the worker picks it up at its next turn boundary
if the task is still running; on a fixed-routed one, that the standing executor does
not take mid-task input and the reply will say so. Neither claims the steer was
absorbed, which the gateway cannot know. The payload spec's refusal posture - both
the fixed-route refusal and the race-window one - is what closes the loop on the
stream.

## The Delegate flow (added 8/31)

A turn starting with the word "delegate" plus a separator routes that one task to a
freshly spawned session worker. The prefix is stripped; the rest of the original text,
casing and punctuation intact, is the task. The gateway mints a fresh bus session name,
publishes the task with the new session as its addressee, and spawns the worker through
the same machinery that serves session-routed conversations - a delegate is an
incarnation, not a new kind of executor, and everything above about incarnations
(minted bus session name per spawn, `contextId` persisting) applies. The guard,
stated because the delete rule below depends on it: a delegation is recognized only
when no live task serializes the conversation. While a task is `working`,
"delegate: …" is a steer like any other text - the routing above claims status asks
and stops first and steers everything else, and the delegate prefix is consulted
only when the turn would start a task. A bare "delegate" with nothing after it is
not a delegation, and while the spawner is dark the prefix is not an affordance at
all: the text passes through as an ordinary turn.

Two rules keep the conversation's route coherent:

- **One task.** The delegation covers exactly the prefixed task. On a fixed-route
  conversation, the next plain ask re-homes to the configured default addressee - never
  to a dead delegate session. On a session-routed conversation, the delegate
  incarnation becomes the next standing incarnation, which is inside the session
  route's contract: incarnations rotate anyway.
- **The previous incarnation dies at delegation, deliberately.** A lingering pod from
  an earlier incarnation is deleted, not merely untracked: reap walks session records
  and sweep sees only terminal pod phases, so an untracked Running pod would hold its
  bus credential with nothing able to reclaim it. The active-task guard above bounds
  which pods this can reach: a delegation is only recognized when no task serializes
  the conversation, so the pod is either idle or running a DETACHED task - and
  detached is not closed, so the deletion rule in Session lifecycle applies and that
  task's terminal is published first. The state is that rule's to name, not this
  section's. With that done, the delete is what reap or sweep would have done anyway.

## Session lifecycle

The session manager is the demo's chatops code generalized from one-shot workers to
long-lived sessions. Four operations:

**Spawn.** First message in a conversation creates the pod: the demo's reference worker
shape (no ambient k8s credentials, scratch on emptyDir, 250m/512Mi requests; egress
fenced (8/31) to DNS, the bus, and LiteLLM - the deployment spec owns the policy),
running the headless harness behind a thin shim that bridges bus envelopes to the CLI's
stream-json stdin/stdout. Model auth, as shipped (amended 8/31): the worker talks to
the install's own LiteLLM, in-namespace, with no per-pod credential at all - the
spawned pod carries no ServiceAccount and no Workload Identity. Its bus credential is
the static worker user, injected as env, until the deployment spec's auth callout
arms; arming it is what gives a session pod a KSA and a projected token, per the
subagent framework's worker posture. Direct Vertex via WI
stays the target, and arming it is a policy change as well as an IAM one: the session
egress fence encodes the shipped path (no 443, no metadata route), which is where a
piecemeal flip fails loudly instead of silently widening. Cold start is 5-10s; the
adapter posts a placeholder to the conversation while the pod comes up, which the demo
already does.

**Stream.** The shim consumes envelopes addressed to its session, feeds them to the
harness, and maps the stream-json output to `status-update` and `artifact-update` events.
The gateway relays events to the conversation. The gateway never parses harness output;
that translation lives in the shim, next to the process it translates for.

**Reap.** Idle TTL since the last user message (30 minutes, config-backed). Reaping is
deleting the pod. Nothing is saved first, because
the stream already has everything - that's the whole point of the transcript of record.
The KV entry stays, holding the `contextId`. Reap never deletes a pod out from under a
live task: an active task that has not detached (see Stop above) exempts the session
from the idle TTL. The exemption is safe because the pod's end has owners. The session
worker's adapter enforces a task deadline (30 minutes default, config-backed): at the
deadline it kills the harness process group and publishes the terminal event itself,
and a pod that dies wedged reaches a terminal phase where Sweep takes over. The
spawner owes the pod-level `activeDeadlineSeconds` mirroring that deadline - the
adapter's contract is written assuming it - so a wedged adapter also lands in Sweep's
domain instead of holding its bus credential indefinitely; until that field ships, a
wedged adapter is the one unowned end, named here rather than papered over. It costs
two things, not one: the held bus credential, and the content posture below - with no
terminal event the active-task record is never deleted, `session-state` has no age
limit, and the `ask` copy outlives the stream copy its justification rests on. The
same missing field closes both, and until it does the gateway owes the record an
independent bound (a bucket TTL, or clearing an active task whose pod no longer
exists) rather than a justification that assumes a terminal that may not come. The
terminal event this chain guarantees is also what deletes the active-task record (and
the `ask` copy riding it). A detached task is the exception on both counts: it does
not exempt the session, so reap may delete a pod whose harness is still working, and
the supervisor rule below is what keeps that from being a silent stop.

**One rule for every pod the gateway deletes itself** (stated once here because four
paths reach it - reap, Sweep, Delegate, and any future one): if the pod is running a
DETACHED task, the gateway publishes that task's terminal event before deleting, as
the supervisor of the sessions it spawns. The state is `canceled`, not `failed`:
every task this rule reaches is detached, and detached means a `stop` already
published a cancel, so the gateway is finishing the cancel the requester asked for
rather than reporting an error. That keeps assertion 13's enumeration intact
(`canceled`, or `completed` if the race was lost) and keeps replay able to tell a
stopped task from one that broke. Deleting first strands the task
non-terminal for the whole retention window - the adapter's deadline dies with the
process, and a deleted pod never reaches the terminal phase Sweep watches for - which
would break both that assertion and the payload spec's every-task-has-a-supervisor
rule. Do not
reason from the config defaults here: the adapter's deadline runs from task start and
the idle TTL from the last user message, so which fires first is a property of two
independently tunable numbers, not a guarantee.

**Rehydrate.** The next message on a reaped conversation spawns a fresh pod. The
gateway replays the context's tasks from JetStream, folds them into a transcript primer,
and hands it to the new pod as its first input. If the harness's own session file
happens to survive (it usually won't), `--resume` is a shortcut - correctness never
depends on it; session files are cache, the stream is the record. Task-stream retention bounds how far
back rehydration reaches (72h placeholder in the payload spec). I think that's a
feature: a three-day-silent thread restarting with fresh context is better than a bot
that suddenly remembers June. If review disagrees, the fix is a compacted transcript
topic, not longer task retention.

**Sweep**, as in the demo: a pod in a terminal phase whose task never emitted a final
event gets a terminal event published by the gateway, then deleted. This is the
gateway's half of the payload spec's orphaned-task answer - it is the supervisor for
sessions it spawned; the dispatcher's janitor is the other half (settled 8/24). The
state follows the same rule as every other supervisor publish below: `failed` for a
task whose executor died mid-work, `canceled` where the task had already detached and
the gateway is finishing a cancel the requester published. Sweep reaches detached
tasks routinely - a worker that exits or wedges after a `stop` leaves exactly this
shape - so an unconditional `failed` here would report broken for every task a user
stopped, which is the distinction the rule exists to keep.

## Requester identity on the bus

The payload spec reserves two envelope fields and this doc names what goes in them.

**`identity` stays empty.** It is the link-level field - the verified identity of the
_publisher_, bound to the authenticated NATS connection. A server-stamped header was
ruled out empirically (8/24); the remaining choice - signed claim vs subject-derived
identity - belongs with the deployment spec's account design and the authority work.
The gateway has no business writing it.

**`authority` is the request-level field, and the gateway populates it.** Who asked,
verified how, in front of whom:

```json
"authority": {
  "requester": {
    "principal": "hmac:9f4c21…",
    "backend": "gchat",
    "subject": "hmac:b8813a…",
    "verifiedBy": "chat-signed-token"
  },
  "audience": {
    "conversation": "gchat:spaces/AAA/threads/BBB",
    "kind": "group",
    "roster": ["hmac:9f4c21…", "hmac:77d0e2…"],
    "rosterComplete": true
  },
  "grants": null
}
```

**Identifiers in `authority` are pseudonymous (decided 8/24).** Principals, subjects,
and roster entries are HMAC-SHA256 with the install's salt before anything is written to
the bus - the same posture the shipped attribution path applies before writing session
metadata (`docs/designs/audit-logging-user-attribution.md`). The bus holds labelled
content at rest for the whole retention window, so it gets the same treatment as the
session KV. The plaintext join lives in the gateway's local ingress log, and the
gateway resolves plaintext at the boundaries that need it - `openDirect` now, the
lowest-common-denominator grant computation when the authority work lands.

**The salt is `SESSION_KV_SALT`, the one the install already provisions** (settled
8/31). It is generated once into `platform-agent-secrets`, deliberately never
rewritten on upgrade - rotating it re-anonymises every user and breaks correlation
with their own history - and it is what the shipped attribution path already hashes
with. Using it is what makes the "same posture" claim above true rather than
approximate: one human hashes to one value in session metadata and in
`authority.requester.principal`, so the cross-surface audit join resolves. A second
salt would not merely be redundant, it would silently yield nothing on exactly the
join this rule exists to preserve. The requirement that follows: one value per
install, read by every gateway replica from that Secret. Deriving a salt from
another credential - the stage 1 gateway derives from the bus password when none is
configured - is a deviation on two counts, the broken join and a de-anonymization
key handed to whoever holds that credential over an identifier space (chat emails, a
room roster) small enough to enumerate.

**The rule covers identifiers, not content (stated explicitly 8/31; it was always the
design, never written down).** Task content cannot be pseudonymized without destroying
it - the executor has to read the ask - so the submission message rides the TASKS
stream in the clear for the whole retention window, which is exactly why the deployment
spec calls W a tenancy decision. What the rule forbids is identifiers that carry
content; the payload spec's opaque-token rule is the same rule seen from the other
side. Within that posture, the gateway may hold a bounded copy of the active task's ask
in the session KV - truncated, one revision, deleted with the active-task record at the
terminal event - for status rendering. The copy adds no new audience (the gateway is
the bucket's only reader and writer, by grant - see the deployment spec's note on the
one residual write route) and has a shorter horizon than the stream copy it
duplicates. What would breach the posture is content anywhere with a wider audience or
a longer life than the stream already grants it - which makes the horizon a condition
on the copy, not a property of it. The horizon holds only where a terminal event is
guaranteed, so the one case Session lifecycle names as unowned (a wedged adapter,
until the pod-level deadline ships) is a case where this justification does not hold
and the record needs the independent bound named there.

- `requester.principal` is the pseudonymized identity in _our_ trust domain; the gateway
  resolves it to the RBAC string at the boundary that needs one. `subject` is the
  backend-native immutable id, hashed likewise, kept for audit joins. `verifiedBy`
  names the mechanism that checked it at ingress.
- `audience` is a snapshot of the room at the moment of the ask (see group chats below).
- `grants` is reserved for the attenuating capability token when the authority work
  lands. Until then it is null and the field is advisory.

How `principal` gets established depends on the backend, and the three are not equal:

- **Google Chat:** requests carry a Google-signed token, and the resolved user email is
  the same string as the cloud principal and the RBAC subject. One trust domain, nothing
  to map. This is why gchat is the supported production ingress.
- **Slack:** join on the immutable `user_id` against a mapping table we maintain from our
  own IdP. Never `profile.email` - whether that field is IdP-asserted or user-editable
  depends on workspace config we don't control.
- **Discord:** a checked-in test mapping table from Discord user id to a test principal.
  Test-only, by construction: a Discord identity never maps to a real cloud principal,
  full stop.

**What advisory means, stated plainly:** the gateway verifies the requester at ingress,
but until connection-bound publisher identity lands, nothing stops another bus client
from publishing an envelope with an invented `authority` block. So consumers MUST NOT
authorize on it yet. It is carried now for the audit trail and for parity testing, and
it becomes decision-grade only when `identity` arms and the deployment spec's accounts
pin who may publish to the task subjects.

The payload spec has carried this rule since 0.3: `authority` is populate-by-gateway-only,
consumers forbidden from deciding on it, libraries pass it through untouched.

## Group chats: who is in the room

Group support is required - teams live in shared channels, and every chat product trains
them to expect the bot there. The full answer (a classifier judging what's appropriate
for a mixed audience, a lowest-common-denominator permissions tool to feed it) comes
later. What the gateway builds now is the substrate those need:

- **Roster.** The adapter tracks membership per conversation from the backend's
  membership API and events. The roster is mapped principals where the mapping exists,
  backend subjects where it doesn't - pseudonymized like every identifier in `authority`.
- **Audience in every envelope.** Each turn's `authority.audience` snapshots the roster
  at ask time. Snapshots, deliberately: when the classifier later asks "who could have
  read this," the answer is in the envelope for that turn, not reconstructed from
  membership history. Rosters cap at 32 entries; past that, `rosterComplete: false` and
  the eventual LCD tool reads membership live instead.
- **A DM-switch primitive.** The adapter interface includes `openDirect(requester)`, so
  a reply can be routed to the asker privately with a notice left in the room. The
  gateway ships the primitive; the classifier that decides to use it comes later. Until
  then everything posts to the room it came from.

One property worth stating because it falls out of the session model: a group session's
context is labeled for the room. Everyone in the thread shares the pod, so anything the
harness reads into context is readable by the whole roster - which is exactly as leaky as
the chat window itself, no more. When per-user authority lands, the
lowest-common-denominator grants for a group session compute against the audience, not
just the requester. That is the LCD question, parked with its tool.

## The test backend

The brief: pick whichever backend gets us to test reality fastest with no review cycle,
and keep the other two as adapters. Comparison:

|                | Google Chat                                                    | Slack                                                        | Discord                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Standup path   | Cloud project, Chat API config, app published to the workspace | App created in a workspace we admin                          | Bot token, self-owned server, invite link |
| Review cycle   | Workspace admin approval                                       | Workspace admin approval (we don't admin the corp workspace) | None - we own the server                  |
| Ingress shape  | Inbound HTTPS endpoint or Pub/Sub                              | Socket Mode (outbound WS) available                          | Outbound WS only, native                  |
| Identity story | Signed token, same trust domain                                | `user_id` + our mapping table                                | Test mapping table only                   |
| Threads / DMs  | Yes / yes                                                      | Yes / yes                                                    | Yes / yes                                 |

**Discord for test reality.** It is the only one of the three with no approval gate of
any kind - we create the server, so there is no admin to wait on - and its bot model is
outbound-websocket-only, which means no inbound endpoint on the dev cluster and no
ingress to secure for a test rig. The identity mapping table is a feature here rather
than a compromise: it keeps a toy backend structurally incapable of asserting a real
principal.

Google Chat stays the supported production ingress, for the trust-domain reason above -
it is the first real adapter, built during stage 2 once the interface is proven against
Discord. Slack follows when a customer asks, with the mapping table as a hard
prerequisite.

The adapter interface is what makes the pick cheap: inbound message with verified sender,
conversation and thread identity, roster read, post-to-conversation, `openDirect`. Five
operations, normalized. If the Discord adapter leaks Discord-isms through that interface,
that's a bug in the interface, and better to learn it on the throwaway backend.

## What stage 2 builds from this doc

- The gateway: Discord adapter, session manager (spawn / stream / reap / rehydrate /
  sweep), bus client, KV session registry.
- The session pod shim: bus-to-stream-json bridge, event mapping.
- The `authority` block, populated at ingress, advisory.
- Roster tracking and the `openDirect` primitive.

Not in stage 2: the classifier, the LCD permissions tool, the gchat and slack adapters,
`grants`, and anything that makes `authority` decision-grade.

## Inherited from the kanban retirement (added 8/24)

The subagent framework's kanban inventory assigns the gateway three rebuilds. Recording
them here so the contract lives in the doc that owns it. They land with the kanban
retirement (stage 3), on the gateway built in stage 2:

- **The rolling progress line.** Render `progress` artifacts into a single edited chat
  message at zero model cost. The bar to meet is the current kanban heartbeat-notes
  rendering.
- **Subscription and wake policy.** Auto-subscribe the originating thread, inherit to
  child tasks, don't wake the requester for routine completion. `correlationId` plus
  durable replay is the substrate; the policy is gateway session state.
- **The report-by-thread store.** A conversation's delivered reports keep enough context
  that "apply Option A" replies resolve. No bus home; gateway session state in KV, like
  the rest of it.

## Open Questions

Calls for [@bnaylor]:

- ~~**Payload spec amendment.**~~ Ratified 8/24; the payload spec has carried it since
  0.3.
- ~~**Idle TTL.**~~ Decided 8/24: 30 minutes, config-backed.
- ~~**Rehydration horizon.**~~ Decided 8/24: retention is the horizon. The compacted
  transcript topic stays the named fix if real users disagree.
- ~~**Discord test tenancy.**~~ Decided 8/24: I own the test server; the bot token is a
  plain Secret in the dev cluster. Test-only posture, stated out loud.
- ~~**Queue vs inject for mid-task messages.**~~ Decided 8/24: inject. The design
  section carries it; the payload spec's steering rule is the A2A shape.
- ~~**Roster cap.**~~ Decided 8/24: 32 stands; large rooms are live-read territory for
  the LCD tool.
