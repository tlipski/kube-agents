# The deployer scans this directory's *.tf only, so every variable that has to
# reach the stack is declared here. Two rules it enforces are worth knowing
# before adding one: an INJECTED variable this stack does not declare is
# dropped silently (which is why `cluster_name`, `node_count` and
# `machine_type` are absent -- this stack builds no cluster and would only be
# confused by them), while a variable named in a task.yaml `variables:` block
# and NOT declared here raises ConfigError. So the task file and this one are a
# matched pair.

# The cluster the Platform Agent pod runs in, and the only cluster this
# scenario can use -- not because k8s-event-watcher is confined to the cluster
# it runs in (it fans in over the Cluster Agent profile clusters as well), but
# because a per-run cluster joins that watch set too late to be watched inside
# the run. main.tf's header carries the argument. hack/ci-eval-pr.sh passes
# these two from HOST_CLUSTER_NAME/REGION -- deliberately not from the per-run
# task cluster the other tofu stacks build, which has no agent on it.

# run's incident, which is the failure a static name would usually invite --
