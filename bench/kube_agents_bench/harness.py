"""``kubeagents`` agent harness: HTTP transport to the in-cluster platform agent.

The agent runs inside the cluster, so this harness only ensures the service is
reachable on a local port (lazily spawning ``kubectl port-forward``) and POSTs
the prompt to its Responses-style endpoint. No model SDK is imported; all
inference happens in the cluster, and reading the reply lives in
:mod:`kube_agents_bench.parsing`.

The platform agent delegates substantive work to subagents by filing a kanban
card and ending its turn -- there is no synchronous await tool, by design. Its
first reply is therefore an acknowledgement carrying a task id, not the answer.
Returning that would have the eval harness grade the acknowledgement and delete
the workspace while the subagent is still running, so a turn that files a card
is followed by status turns on the same conversation until every card settles
(see :meth:`KubeAgentsHarness._await_delegated_work`).

Registration is the ``devops_bench.agents`` entry point in ``pyproject.toml``,
so importing this module has no side effects.

Environment:
    AGENT_LOCAL_PORT: Local side of the port-forward (default ``8642``). The
        remote side is always the Service's 8642 and is not configurable.
    AGENT_API_PATH: Request path (default ``/v1/responses``).
    AGENT_SERVICE_NAME: Service to port-forward to (default ``platform-agent``).
    AGENT_NAMESPACE: Namespace of the service (default ``kubeagents-system``).
    AGENT_CLUSTER_CONTEXT: Optional kubectl context for the port-forward.
    AGENT_CONTAINER: Container to exec into when reading back a delegated card's
        artifacts and clearing its state (default ``platform-agent``).
    AGENT_MODEL_NAME: ``model`` field sent to the endpoint (default
        ``model-default``, the name the operator pins on ``/v1/models`` via
        ``API_SERVER_MODEL_NAME`` and the one LiteLLM actually serves).
    AGENT_CONVERSATION_ID: Pins the ``conversation`` field. Unset (the default)
        generates a fresh id per invocation so each task's trajectory is
        isolated on this stateful endpoint.
    AGENT_HTTP_TIMEOUT: Per-request timeout in seconds (default ``600``).
    AGENT_DELEGATION_TIMEOUT: Total seconds to wait for delegated work across
        all status turns (default ``1800``). ``0`` disables waiting, restoring
        the single-turn behaviour.
    AGENT_DELEGATION_POLL_INTERVAL: Seconds between status turns (default ``30``).
    PLATFORM_AGENT_TOKEN: Bearer token for the endpoint.
