"""Generate the documentation tables that mirror machine-readable sources.

Several reference tables in this repository restate information that already
exists in a file the code reads: the cron schedule lives in ``jobs.json``, the
skill catalogue lives in each skill's frontmatter, and the provisioning steps
live in the scripts themselves. Maintaining those tables by hand guarantees they
drift. This script regenerates them from the source of truth instead.

There are two kinds of target. Most are a *region* spliced into a hand-written
document (``BLOCKS``). One is a *whole file* written verbatim from its
generator (``FILES``): ``docs/family-roster.txt`` carries no markers, has no
hand-written part, and is replaced in full on every run.

Each generated region is delimited in its target file by::

    <!-- BEGIN GENERATED: <block-id> -->
    <!-- END GENERATED: <block-id> -->

or, in ``.mdx`` files (where MDX rejects HTML comments), by::

    {/* BEGIN GENERATED: <block-id> */}
    {/* END GENERATED: <block-id> */}

Everything outside those markers is hand-written and is never touched. A
whole-file target has no such boundary — nothing in it is hand-written.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/generate_docs.py            # rewrite the generated targets
    python3 scripts/generate_docs.py --check    # exit 1 if anything is stale

``--check`` is what CI runs: if regenerating would change a file, the committed
documentation no longer matches its source.

Standard library only, deliberately -- this must run in CI and in a bare clone
without installing anything.
