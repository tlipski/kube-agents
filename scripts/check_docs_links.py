"""Verify that relative links in Markdown resolve to files that exist.

This catches the failure mode that actually occurs in this repository: a
relative path that was correct when written and silently broke when a file
moved or a directory was renamed.

Scope is deliberately narrow and offline:

* relative links and image paths are resolved against the linking file and
  must point at a git-tracked file (or a directory) -- existence on disk is
  not enough, because generated or ignored files exist in a local clone but
  not in a fresh checkout or on GitHub;
* ``http(s)``, ``mailto:`` and protocol-relative links are not fetched;
* site-absolute routes (``/kube-agents/...``) are Starlight routes rather than
  paths on disk, so they are skipped -- broken ones surface as a failed site
  build in ``docs-build.yml``;
* anchors are stripped before resolution, and a bare ``#anchor`` is skipped.

Standard library only, so it runs in CI and in a bare clone.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/check_docs_links.py
