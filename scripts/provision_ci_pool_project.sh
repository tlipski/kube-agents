# Unified Provisioning Script for CI Pool Projects
# ==============================================================================
# Provisions all GCP, GKE, IAM, Artifact Registry, Seeded Fleet, and Token
# Minter infrastructure required to onboard a GCP project into the Prow Boskos
# evaluation pool (kube-agents-evals-project).
#
# Follows the sequence codified in
# docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/ci-pool-projects.md.
#
# The project itself and its billing link are preconditions: this script
# provisions *into* a project that already exists and already bills.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/provision_ci_pool_project.sh --project-id=kube-agents-evals-4
#   ./scripts/provision_ci_pool_project.sh --project-id=kube-agents-evals-3 --pem-file=/path/to/app.pem
