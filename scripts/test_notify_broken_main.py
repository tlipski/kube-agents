"""Unit tests for the broken-main issue notifier.

Run: cd scripts && python3 -m unittest test_notify_broken_main

The notifier cannot be exercised end to end before it is on main -- a
`workflow_run` workflow only runs from the default branch's copy of itself -- so
everything that can be decided without a runner is decided here. Three failure
modes are worth more than the rest: staying quiet when main is broken, which
reproduces the gap this exists to close; opening an issue on a green run, which
trains everyone to ignore the label; and leaving an issue open after main
recovers, which does the same thing more slowly.
