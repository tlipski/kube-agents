# should promote anything.
#
# Two decisions, deliberately separate:
#
#   skip_pipeline   there is nothing worth deploying: either no validated
#                   candidate exists at all, or the newest one predates the
#                   shared-pipeline restructure and the workflows would drive it
#                   with scripts and a suite selector its tree does not have.
#   skip_promotion  the candidate is already promoted — a staging_* tag points at
#                   its commit. The night still deploys and tests it; only the tag
#                   push is skipped. That is what makes re-running the pipeline on
#                   the same candidate a no-op rather than a second tag, and it is
#                   why the nightly matrix keeps running on quiet nights.
#
# Every skip is exit 0. The exits that are not: a tag that does not resolve to a
# commit, and a hand-passed tag the RC pipeline never validated or whose tree
# predates the shared-pipeline restructure. Both hand-passed cases fail rather
# than skip, because a caller who named a candidate is owed an answer about that
# candidate rather than a green run that quietly tested nothing.
#
# Selection and the validation check both come from common.sh rather than being
# re-implemented here: a second answer to "is this commit validated" is how the RC
# gate and the promotion gate drift apart.
