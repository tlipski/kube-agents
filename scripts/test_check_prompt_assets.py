"""Tests for check_prompt_assets.py.

Two kinds of test here, and the split is deliberate.

The synthetic ones build a miniature profile in a temporary directory and point
the checker at it. They are the ones that prove each rule *fires* -- a lint
nobody has watched fail is a lint nobody knows is wired up, and this one has to
be trusted enough to gate on.

The rest run against the real repository. They are not "does the repository
pass" assertions dressed up as tests; they pin the two things that would
silently turn this check into a no-op: the `/opt/defaults` layout model going
stale against the Dockerfile, and the reference-shaped strings that must keep
being ignored. A lint that stops reporting anything looks exactly like a clean
repository.
