"""Pre-flight verification for onboarding a GCP project into the CI evaluation pool.

Validates that a project has completed every prerequisite in
docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/ci-pool-projects.md before it is registered in
the Boskos resource pool in gke-internal/test-infra.

Registering a project that has not finished onboarding does not fail only that
project: Boskos hands the half-built lease to some pull request, and that pull
request's smoke test dies. Run this before the Boskos entry lands.
