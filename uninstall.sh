Usage: ./uninstall.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -y, --yes, --non-interactive  Automated execution mode (no interactive confirmation prompt)
  --dry-run                     Preview uninstall plan without deleting resources
  --project-id ID               GCP Target Project ID
  --cluster-name NAME           GKE Target Cluster Name (default: platform-agent-host)
  --region REGION               GKE GCP Region
  --source-ref REF              Tag or commit SHA of the release that made the install; that
                                release's own uninstall.sh is fetched and run in place of this one
  --help, -h, -?                Show this help message

Examples:
  # Interactively discover and remove kube-agents cluster & GCP resources
  ./uninstall.sh

  # Automated teardown for a known project and cluster
  ./uninstall.sh --non-interactive --project-id="my-gcp-project" --cluster-name="platform-agent-host"

Exit codes:
  0  Teardown completed (or --dry-run finished, or you declined the
     confirmation).
  3  Nothing to tear down: no Terraform state for this cluster in GCS or
     locally. Either nothing is installed here, or the install predates the
     Terraform engine — see --source-ref. Not a failure.
  1  Anything else — the teardown could not start, or started and did not
     finish.

  --source-ref hands over to the pinned release's own uninstall.sh wholesale,
  so from then on the exit code is that release's, not this contract.
