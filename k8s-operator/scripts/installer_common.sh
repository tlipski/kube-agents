# Autopilot, because it is the shape this project is developed and validated
# against: the autopush and staging installs already run it, the chart needs no
# node pool, and gVisor comes from Autopilot's built-in RuntimeClass rather than
# a dedicated pool. Standard remains a first-class choice and is what
# --cluster-mode=standard, CLUSTER_MODE=standard, or a hand-written tfvars
# selects; it is also required for a zonal install, which Autopilot cannot do.
#
# This decides ONE thing: the shape a FRESH install creates. It never reaches a
# cluster that already exists -- see write_tfvars_from_state, where every branch
# with a live cluster takes its mode from the probe instead.

# Vertex serves each model from its own subset of locations, and the cluster's
# region is usually not one of them -- gemini-3.5-flash, the vertex_ai default,
# is not served from us-central1 (DEFAULT_REGION), so a region-derived default
# 404s on a stock install. The global endpoint serves the first-party Gemini
# models from wherever has capacity, which is the only default that works
# without knowing the cluster's region. Two reasons to override it: it gives no
# in-region ML processing guarantee, and a Model Garden partner model (Claude,
# Llama, Mistral) may be served only from specific regions. Which locations

# the one predefined GKE role carrying container.clusters.impersonate. GKE grants
# IAM roles at the project level (a cluster is not a resource an IAM policy can
# attach to), so that impersonation covers every cluster in the project and the
# grant cannot be narrowed to one. An operator who genuinely needs broad roles
# uses `custom` and lists them, which makes the grant explicit and reviewable
# instead of hiding it behind one word.

  # install that already exists. uninstall.sh is the one that matters: vars.sh

  # fresh clone that has none. Defaulting on for that caller would let the
  # Autopilot version-floor check below abort a destroy, leaving an install

  # the ordinary one — a teardown from the checkout that installed sources a
