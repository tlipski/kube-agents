	// alone by default. A slot is held for a worker's entire run, so capping serialises
	// minutes of model work: measured against real fan-outs on a live cluster, capping at
	// 2 roughly doubled the time for a batch to finish. Do NOT reach for a lower value as
	// a latency fix — an uncapped fan-out does spawn every sandboxed worker at once and
	// they contend during startup, but a cap trades minutes of model work for seconds of
	// boot. What the workers contend for is not established either — CPU limit, memory
	// ceiling and gVisor I/O all fit the evidence, and gVisor hides the cgroup throttle
	// counters that would settle it — so raising resources is not a guaranteed fix;

	// LEAVE THIS OFF for now. The broker runs proxied commands in a working
	// directory the agent created on the shared data volume, so today both Pods
	// have to mount that claim read-write at the same path and see the same
	// files. The default GKE persistent disk is ReadWriteOnce and cannot do

	// That coupling is a property of the current directory-sharing design, not

	// Pod. "None" (the default) renders nothing.
	//
	// "Allowlist" renders a default-deny egress policy that permits only the
	// destinations the agent legitimately needs. Because NetworkPolicy has no
	// deny rule, a destination is denied by not appearing on the list, and the
	// link-local metadata server — 169.254.169.254, where anything that can
	// make an HTTP request can mint the node or Workload Identity service
	// account's tokens — is one of the destinations left off.
	//
	// READ THIS BEFORE YOU BELIEVE THE NAME. THIS FIELD BLOCKS NOTHING TODAY.
	// Not the metadata server, not anything else. Setting it to Allowlist can
	// only widen what the agent Pod may send, never narrow it.
	//
	// That is not a bug in the rules below; it is what NetworkPolicy does.
	// Policies selecting one Pod are unioned — the Pod may send whatever any of
	// them permits — and the API has no deny rule, so an added policy is a
	// monotone operation. It cannot subtract. The agent Pod is already selected
	// for egress by <name>-gateway-netpol, which the operator renders on every
	// reconcile whether this field is set or not — unless
	// spec.networkPolicy.enabled is false, which withholds the gateway policy.
	// On a Helm install that makes this the Pod's only policy: the one shape
	// where this field enforces for real on an enforcing CNI, denying
	// everything off its list. A Kustomize install still carries the static
	// platform-agent-core-egress set over the same Pod, so the union resumes
	// there. Everywhere else, turning this on leaves the
	// Pod's permitted egress a strict superset of what it was. In the default
	// shape the only destination it adds is the credential broker on TCP 8765
	// — plus, when the agent is not exporting telemetry, the collector
	// namespace on 4317/4318, because the gateway policy omits its own OTel
	// rule in that case and this one is rendered unconditionally. Anything
	// egressAllowlist names is added on top of that.
	//
	// What the gateway policy already permits, and therefore what this cannot
	// take away:
	//
	//   - 169.254.169.254/32 on TCP 80, plus the discovered metadata-daemon port (988 by default) to both link-local
	//     metadata addresses — the pre- and post-DNAT forms of a metadata
	//     request (the 988 rule is suppressed when the resolved metadata
	//     daemon IP is empty). So the metadata path stays open.
	//   - TCP 443 to 0.0.0.0/0 minus the private ranges, unless the
	//     FQDNNetworkPolicy annotation is set. So every HTTPS destination on
	//     the public internet stays open, and with it the exfiltration half of
	//     what this control is meant to be.
	//
	// A Kustomize install additionally applies platform-agent-core-egress
	// (deploy/kustomize/platform/networkpolicy-core-egress.yaml), which selects
	// the agent Pod by app.kubernetes.io/name and permits the same metadata
	// path. A Helm install does not carry it, and it changes nothing either
	// way: the gateway policy alone is enough to make the point above.
	//
	// The overlap is deliberate rather than an oversight. Workload Identity
	// needs the metadata path, and in the sidecar layout the credential broker
	// shares the Pod, so <name>-gateway-netpol cannot stop permitting it
	// without breaking every install. Narrowing it to the broker Pod once the
	// broker has left is the work that turns this field into a control.
	//
	// So what is this for today? Two things, and they are worth having, but
	// neither is enforcement. It renders an auditable statement of the
	// destinations the agent is supposed to need, in an object an operator can
	// diff and a reviewer can read. And it establishes the field, the refusal
	// rules and the reconcile behaviour, so that narrowing the gateway policy
	// later is a change to one policy rather than a new feature.
	//
	// REQUIRES splitCredentialBrokerPod: true. Containers in one Pod share a
	// network namespace, and the credential broker reaches the metadata server
	// on purpose: minting the cloud token is its job. A Pod-level NetworkPolicy
	// cannot deny the metadata server to the agent container while allowing it
	// to the broker container beside it. Asking for the combination is refused
	// with Degraded/EgressPolicyRequiresSplitBroker rather than rendered — so
	// the default install, which has the split off, has none of this.
	//
	// Three further conditions the operator cannot check for you.
	//
	//   - The policy does nothing at all on a cluster whose CNI does not
	//     enforce NetworkPolicy (GKE Standard without network policy enabled);
	//     Autopilot and GKE Dataplane V2 always enforce. An unenforced policy
	//     is stored and returned by kubectl exactly like an enforced one, so
	//     there is nothing for the operator to read.
	//   - Any other policy in the namespace that selects this Pod and permits
	//     wider egress re-opens what this one closes, as the two above do.
	//   - NodeLocal DNSCache, if the cluster runs it, may lose DNS entirely.
	//     It runs hostNetwork, so on Cilium and Dataplane V2 its traffic
	//     carries a host or remote-node identity, which neither the
	//     k8s-app: node-local-dns Pod selector nor the 169.254.20.10/32 CIDR
	//     peer in the rendered DNS rule is guaranteed to match. Both work on
	//     an iptables dataplane, which is why both are rendered. This is the
	//     only one of the three that can take the agent down rather than
	//     quietly weaken it — every allowlisted destination is reached by
	//     name, so no DNS means no egress at all. Check
	//     `kubectl -n kube-system get ds node-local-dns` and confirm
	//     resolution from the agent container after enabling.
	//
	// WHAT IT WILL COST, once the gateway policy is narrowed and this field
	// starts blocking things. None of the following happens today, for the
	// reason above: every destination on this list is one <name>-gateway-netpol
	// still permits to the same Pod. Read it as the bill that falls due, not as
	// the current behaviour — and do not schedule a capability review for a
	// change that will not alter anything yet.
	//
	// The allowlist covers DNS, the credential broker, LiteLLM, the managed
	// OpenTelemetry collector, and whatever egressAllowlist adds. Everything
	// else the agent container reaches on its own would go away:
	//
	//   - DuckDuckGo web search, which the shared default config turns on for
	//     every profile, and the "browser" toolset, which only the Chat Agent
	//     disables;
	//   - the gke and developer_knowledge MCP servers, which proxy
	//     container.googleapis.com and developerknowledge.googleapis.com;
	//   - github.com reached directly from the sandbox, though not the gh and
	//     git wrappers, which go through the broker;
	//   - the metadata lookup in cluster_agent_reconcile.py, which finds that
	//     script's project id. It fails soft after a five-second timeout and
	//     falls back to a broker gcloud call; set RECONCILE_PROJECT to skip it.
	//
	// Those would not be accidental casualties. A headless browser with
	// unrestricted egress is the exfiltration path, so the capabilities this
	// would remove are the same ones that make the control worth having. Restore
	// individual destinations with egressAllowlist.extraRules — noting that
	// NetworkPolicy matches addresses, never DNS names, so restoring a hosted
	// service means naming its address ranges.
	//
	// Credentialed gcloud, kubectl, gh and git are unaffected: they are shims
	// that call the broker, and the broker is on the allowlist.
	//
	// TURNING THIS OFF DOES NOT DELETE THE POLICY. An egress policy is a
	// guardrail, and the operator will not remove a guardrail it may not have
	// created, so setting this back to "None" leaves
	// <name>-sandbox-metadata-deny in place. That is fail-closed and harmless
	// on its own. Reverting both flags together leaves the returned broker
	// inside the leftover policy's selection — which the gateway policy's
	// union papers over today, by the same argument as above, but which
	// becomes a broker cut off from the metadata server the moment the
	// gateway policy is narrowed or absent (networkPolicy.enabled: false).
	// Treat the order below as required rather than relying on the union to
	// keep saving it.
	//
	// Revert in three steps, which never leaves a broker inside a policy that
	// denies it:
	//
	//   1. set egressPolicy: None, leaving splitCredentialBrokerPod: true;
	//   2. kubectl -n NS delete networkpolicy NAME-sandbox-metadata-deny
	//      (safe now — with the field off the operator will not re-apply it,
	//      whereas deleting it while the field is still "Allowlist" only
	//      earns it back on the next reconcile);
	//   3. set splitCredentialBrokerPod: false.
