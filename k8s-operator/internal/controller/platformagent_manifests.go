// renderConfigYAML builds the MANAGED config the pod runs under.
//
// Unlike every other profile rendering, this one is not an overlay merged into the PVC.
// It is emitted as the `managed-config.yaml` ConfigMap key, mounted read-only at
// /etc/hermes/config.yaml, and Hermes overlays it leaf-by-leaf on top of whichever
// config it has just loaded — see the managedScopeDir block for the full contract and
// the three enforcement points. Two earlier arrangements failed:
//
//   - subPath-mounting this rendering over $HERMES_HOME/config.yaml. A subPath is a
//     read-only mount POINT, so the agent could save nothing to its own config at all
//     (`/sethome` returned EACCES); and the entrypoint force-copied the image's config
//     over the mount anyway, so none of these keys reached a running pod.
//   - merging it into the PVC file at startup. That fixed the writability but left every
//     merged key mutable: an agent that repointed model.base_url at nothing kept that
//     across restarts, because the merge treated the runtime's edit as the newer one.
//
// THE MANAGED SCOPE IS MACHINE-GLOBAL — it is NOT the default profile's overlay.
// get_managed_dir() takes no profile argument (managed_scope.py), so every leaf below
// lands on the platform specialist and on each scaffolded cluster agent exactly as it
// lands on the front door. And a leaf REPLACES the profile's own value rather than
// merging into it — a list is a leaf too, so `platform_toolsets.cli` rendered here
// rewrote every specialist's toolset list to the front door's two-tool delegation
// surface, and `agent.disabled_toolsets` took the specialists' terminal away. Nothing
// profile-shaped may be rendered here for that reason: toolsets, disabled toolsets,
// kanban tuning, terminal cwd, mcp servers, the plugin roster and the memory provider
// are each profile's own, and stay in that profile's config.yaml in the image.
//
// WHAT BELONGS HERE is the intersection of two tests: identical for every profile in
// the pod, AND beyond the agent's own repair once broken. That is the model endpoint —
// an agent that repoints base_url at nothing cannot be told to put it back, because
// being told requires the endpoint — and the chat platform wiring that carries the
// human's only channel to it. `approvals.cron_mode` rides along as a third: it is
// uniform by design, and Hermes' own default is `deny`. Everything else is recoverable
// the way it was broken, by a human telling the agent to fix its own config, and so
// stays writable.
//
// Keys this function says nothing about stay the image's, and stay writable: that is
// what keeps `/sethome`, the monitoring install id and saved slash-command preferences
// working. `platforms.<x>.home_channel` is deliberately among them — `/sethome` writes
// it, and a leaf rendered here would overwrite the human's choice at every load.
//
// The operator's other settings for the front door are not lost, they take the other
// route: renderDefaultProfileOverlayYAML emits profile-default.overlay.yaml, which the
// entrypoint merges into the agent's own config.yaml with lists UNIONED. Anything
// operator-owned that must remain mutable — plugins.enabled above all — belongs there

	// It owns port 8643, which the Service targets, and it shares a network
	// namespace with the agent sandbox. As an ordinary container the two started
	// in parallel and raced for the bind. The agent wins that race whenever it
	// wants to: bind 0.0.0.0:8643 from the sandbox and the proxy dies with
	// EADDRINUSE into CrashLoopBackOff, leaving the agent holding the port the
	// Service routes to. Reproduced on a live cluster on 10 August.
	//
	// A native sidecar starts before any app container, so the proxy is running
	// before the sandbox process exists and the race stops being one the agent
	// can win by starting first.
	//
	// Note what the kubelet actually waits for: the sidecar having STARTED, plus
	// its startupProbe if it declares one. This container declares only a
	// readinessProbe, which gates pod readiness and gates nothing about app
	// container startup -- so the guarantee is ordering of process creation, not
	// "Envoy has bound 8643". That is a much smaller window than two containers
	// racing from the same instant, and it is not zero. Give this container a
	// startupProbe on 8643 if the remaining window ever matters.
	//
	// This is also the ordering the pod needs for its own sake: every credentialed
	// call the agent makes goes through this proxy, so an agent that starts first
	// is an agent whose early tool calls fail.
	//
	// Requires Kubernetes 1.29+. SidecarContainers is beta and on by default there;
	// it went GA in 1.33 and was alpha (off) in 1.28. 1.29 is the floor because that
	// is where restartPolicy on an init container starts being honoured without a
	// feature gate.
	//
	// On 1.28 the install fails fast rather than degrading: dropDisabledFields
	// strips restartPolicy, which leaves an ordinary init container still
	// declaring the readinessProbe buildCredentialProxySidecar sets, and
	// validateInitContainers does not permit probes without restartPolicy:
	// Always. So the API server rejects the pod template and the operator's
	// apply fails -- nothing is created, nothing hangs, and there is no window
	// where the proxy is running without sidecar semantics.
	// charts/kube-agents/Chart.yaml pins the same floor, so Helm refuses the
	// install before it gets that far.
	//
	// None of that applies once spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod moves the
	// broker into a Pod of its own: there is no shared network namespace and so
	// no bind to race for. What stays behind in the agent Pod is the front door
	// for the agent's own API, which cannot follow the broker across the Pod
