// The credential broker in its own Pod.
//
// Everything here is dead code unless spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod is
// true, and it stays off by default until the workspace stops being shared.
//
// The reason is the working directory. The broker runs proxied commands in a
// directory the *agent* created, and refuses any working directory outside that
// root (credential_proxy.py, CommandExecutor._execute). Two Pods therefore have
// to see the same files, which is a property of the current directory-sharing
// design rather than of the split. It is also the security problem: a tree the
// agent owns is a tree the agent can write .git/config into, which is the class
// argument-level hardening cannot close by enumeration.
//
// The decided answer is content-passing: the broker owns the workspace on a
// volume of its own, ordinary ReadWriteOnce, and the agent hands it
// {path, content} pairs and a commit message instead of a directory. That
// removes the coupling and the .git class together. It is being built
// separately, and this flag stays off until it lands.
//
// A ReadWriteMany claim is one way to make two Pods see the same files today,
// and an operator may choose it. It is not what the product asks for, and it
// must not become what the product asks for: the managed options bill on
// provisioned capacity with a floor far above what an agent workspace needs,
// which is an adoption tax on installs that run in someone else's environment.
// Co-scheduling the two Pods on one node against a ReadWriteOnce claim is not
// an answer either — a rolling update deadlocks on the volume, node affinity is
// only honoured at scheduling time, and the two Pods become one failure domain.
//
// What the split buys is that the agent no longer shares a network namespace
// with the process holding the cloud credentials, so "reachable on 127.0.0.1"
// stops being an access-control mechanism. What it costs is that the broker
// call becomes a network call, which is why it cannot land without the
// authentication in credential_proxy.py.

// validateCredentialBrokerSplit returns a Degraded reason and message when

// There is one such case, and it is the event watcher. start-services.sh runs
// the watcher inside the credential container, gated by EVENT_WATCHER_ENABLED,
// and the watcher posts what it sees to the Session KV server the sandbox binds
// on 127.0.0.1:8699. Both of those are properties of sharing a Pod. Split the
// broker and the watcher goes with it: no loopback to reach the sandbox on, and
// no SESSION_KV_API_KEY, which the operator sets only in the sidecar branch
// because there is no shared loopback for it to authenticate across. Measured on
// a cluster, the result is the watcher exiting and being retried forever while
// the container stays Ready and no cluster event reaches the agent.
//
// So the two are refused together rather than rendered. Note that
// eventWatcherEnabled defaults to true, so this fires for anyone who enables the
// split without also turning the watcher off — which is the intent. The choice
// between the split and fleet event delivery is the operator's to make with the
// facts in front of them, not one to discover from a log line weeks later.
//
// The alternative was to force EVENT_WATCHER_ENABLED=false under the split. A
// quietly disabled observability component is worse than a refusal: nothing in
// the CR or in kubectl describe would say the events had stopped. Giving the
// watcher a home the split does not strand — a Service in front of the Session
// KV server, or the watcher moved into the agent Pod — is the real fix and is
