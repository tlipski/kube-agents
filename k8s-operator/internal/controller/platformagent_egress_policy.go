// Default-deny egress for the agent Pod, and with it the metadata-server deny.
//
// # Why this is one object and not two
//
// The obvious shape is two policies: one that denies the metadata server, one
// that restricts everything else. NetworkPolicy does not work that way.
// Policies selecting the same Pod are additive — the Pod may send whatever the
// union of their rules permits — so a policy that says "all destinations except
// the metadata server" does not subtract anything from a second policy's
// allowlist, it adds the entire internet to it. There is no deny rule in
// NetworkPolicy at all. Denying is what you get by not allowing.
//
// So there is one policy, it is default-deny, and the metadata server is denied
// because it does not appear on the list.
//
// # Why not the "0.0.0.0/0 except 169.254.169.254/32" form
//
// That is what this repository shipped in fb99cd1 and it is unsound twice over
// on GKE, which is the platform this product targets:
//
//   - GKE Dataplane V2 — the default dataplane, and mandatory on Autopilot —
//     documents that "Pod traffic is never covered by an ipBlock rule". A
//     policy whose only peer is 0.0.0.0/0 therefore permits no Pod-to-Pod
//     traffic at all: not kube-dns, not LiteLLM, not the broker. It reads as
//     permissive and behaves as a near-total outage.
//   - The DNAT ordering defeats the except clause on Calico. A Pod's request to
//     169.254.169.254:80 is translated to the node-local gke-metadata-server at
//     169.254.169.252:988 in NAT PREROUTING, before iptables-based policy is
//     evaluated, so the address the policy names is not the address the policy
//     sees. kubernetes/kubernetes#68078 is that bug, reported in 2018 and still
//     the reason "put it in except" is bad advice.
//
// A default-deny allowlist is immune to both: it names Pods with selectors
// rather than CIDRs, and it does not have to predict which address the
// metadata request will have been rewritten to, because neither address is
// permitted.
//
// # What this control does not do
//
// It is a real control in exactly one configuration and the operator says so
// out loud rather than rendering something that looks protective:
//
//   - It requires spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod. The broker mints the
//     cloud token from the metadata server — that is its function — and a
//     Pod-level policy cannot tell two containers in one network namespace
//     apart. validateEgressPolicy refuses the reconcile in the sidecar layout
//     and reports Degraded, and nothing is rendered.
//   - It does nothing whatsoever on a cluster whose CNI does not enforce
//     NetworkPolicy. The operator cannot detect that: an unenforced policy is
//     accepted by the API server, stored, and returned by kubectl get exactly
//     like an enforced one. There is no field, condition or event to read.
//   - It can be undone from outside, and today it is. Policies selecting one
//     Pod are additive, and two others select this one and permit the metadata
//     path: <name>-gateway-netpol, which this same operator renders on every
//     reconcile (buildNetworkPolicy — 169.254.169.254/32 on TCP 80, the
//     discovered metadata-daemon port (988 by default) to both link-local
//     metadata addresses, and TCP 443 to 0.0.0.0/0 minus
//     the private ranges), and platform-agent-core-egress from
//     deploy/kustomize/platform, on installs that apply it. So the policy
//     below denies the metadata server, and the Pod it selects can still
//     reach it. Narrowing the gateway policy is not done here: Workload
//     Identity needs that path and, in the sidecar layout, the broker sharing
//     the Pod is what needs it. Scoping it to the broker Pod once the broker
//     has left is the follow-up.
