# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

This repository contains the Kubernetes Agentic Harness (`kube-agents`). It is a collection of agent configurations, personas, and skills designed to manage Kubernetes/GKE operations. It utilizes a Platform Agent to transition from reactive manual management to proactive, intent-driven operations.

## Repository Layout

- `agents/`: Source of truth for agent blueprints (personas and skills).
  - `chat/`: The Chat Agent front door — the `default` Hermes profile that receives chat ingress and delegates to specialists.
  - `platform/`: Configuration for the Platform Agent, scaffolded at pod startup into the `platform` profile.
  - `cluster/`: The Cluster Agent profile _template_ (persona, scoped config, and runtime-debugging skills). The Platform Agent scaffolds this into per-cluster Hermes profiles at runtime; it is not deployed directly.
- `.agents/skills/`: Repository-level skills, not shipped in the agent images — review skills (security audits, docs-drift, skill quality) run against pull requests and clusters, plus the `install-kube-agents`/`uninstall-kube-agents`/`upgrade-kube-agents` lifecycle skills that drive the repository's installer scripts.
- `charts/`: Canonical Helm charts (`kube-agents`) for deploying the Kube-Agents operator and profiles.
- `terraform/`: Companion reusable Terraform modules (`gke-cluster`, `kube-agents-iam`, `chat-pubsub`, `github-minter`) for infrastructure provisioning, plus `examples/full-install/`, the single-apply composition that installs the Helm chart on top.
- `deploy/`: Deployment infrastructure code (Dockerfile, Kustomize bases, shared runtime assets).
- `docs/`: Documentation.
  - `site/`: The published documentation site (Astro + Starlight) — the canonical home for
    user-facing docs.
  - `architecture/`: The end-state architecture specification (`01`–`08`). Describes the target, not
    what ships today.
  - `designs/`: Per-feature design documents.
- `k8s-operator/`: Go/Kubebuilder operator reconciling `PlatformAgent` Custom Resources, plus provisioning scripts.
- `examples/`: Example integrations (LiteLLM provider configs, vLLM serving, inference replay).
- `bench/`: Evaluation harness that runs [kubernetes-sigs/devops-bench](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/devops-bench) against the Platform Agent as a pip-installed library.
- `INSTALL.md`: Installation guide.
- `README.md`: Project overview.

## Agent Setup & Integration

This repository is primarily a configuration and documentation repository for AI agents. The main exception is the Go-based Kubernetes operator in `k8s-operator/`, which requires compilation (see Local Validation Checks below).

To use these agents:

1. Follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to set up and register the Platform Agent in your agent harness.
2. Refer to the documentation site content in [docs/site/src/content/docs/](docs/site/src/content/docs/) for architecture, concepts, and operational guides.

## Before Starting a Task

Many people and agents work in this repository at once, so the first step of a non-trivial task
is finding out whether someone is already doing it. Scan the open work and report what you find
to the user **before** you write code. Skip the scan only when the user has already named the
issue or pull request you are working on, or when the change is a one-liner they asked for
directly.

Branches live on forks, so name the upstream repository on every call:

```bash
# Open PRs, with the files each one touches. File overlap is the strongest duplicate
# signal and one call gets it for every open PR.
gh pr list --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,author,headRefName,isDraft,updatedAt,files

# Open issues, and who has already claimed them.
gh issue list --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --state open --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,assignees,labels

# Already tried? A closed pull request is a decision, not an absence.
gh search prs --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --state closed --limit 20 '<keywords>'
```

Then report before you start:

- **An open pull request touches your files or solves your problem.** Give the number, author,
  and URL, and say how your task differs. Do not push to someone else's branch and do not open
  a competing pull request without the user's go-ahead. Overlap alone is a merge-conflict
  warning, not a stop sign — say which it is.
- **An open issue describes the task and is unassigned.** Give the number and title, offer to
  claim it, and say what you would comment. Assign or comment only after the user agrees:
  `gh issue edit <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --add-assignee @me`. `@me` is the account
  whose token you hold — a person — so you are volunteering them, not yourself. Contributors
  working from a fork without write access cannot self-assign; offer a comment instead.
- **The issue is assigned to someone else.** Report it and ask before starting anything.
- **Nothing matches.** Say so in one line and carry on.

Carry the result into the pull request's **Context** section — `Closes #<number>`, or the
related open pull request and how yours differs.
[`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) already reserves that
section for it.

This is not the `status:in-progress` claim in
[`agents/platform/skills/github-issue-resolver/SKILL.md`](agents/platform/skills/github-issue-resolver/SKILL.md).
That is the deployed Platform Agent claiming an issue on a user's repository at runtime. Here
the assignee is the claim; do not apply `status:` labels to issues in this repository.

## Skills Guidelines

- Skills are located under `agents/platform/skills/` (Platform Agent: provisioning, governance, cost, manifest generation, GitOps) and `agents/cluster/skills/` (Cluster Agent: single-cluster runtime debugging and operations).
- Each skill directory must contain a `SKILL.md` file providing instructions for that specific skill.
- Place a skill according to its persona: fleet/provisioning/GitOps-write skills belong to the Platform Agent; read-only, single-cluster runtime-debugging skills belong to the Cluster Agent.
- When adding new skills, ensure they follow the existing structure and are clearly documented to be understood by AI agents.

## Documentation Guidelines

Every fact has one home. Duplicating documentation across files is how it goes stale, so before
adding a paragraph, check whether the topic already has an owner:

| Content                                                  | Canonical home                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| User-facing narrative, how-to, and reference             | `docs/site/src/content/docs/`                |
| End-state architecture                                   | `docs/architecture/`                         |
| Per-feature design rationale                             | `docs/designs/`                              |
| What each provisioning script does                       | `k8s-operator/scripts/README.md`             |
| The install procedure (self-contained, agent-executable) | `INSTALL.md`                                 |
| What the agent is and is not permitted to do             | the site's `reference/security-and-iam.md`   |
| How to develop a specific directory                      | that directory's `README.md` (keep it short) |

Rules:

- **Do not hand-write a table that mirrors a machine-readable file.** The cron schedule, the skill
  catalogue, and the provisioning steps are generated into `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED -->` regions by
  `scripts/generate_docs.py`, which also writes `docs/family-roster.txt` whole. Edit the source,
  then run `make docs-generate`.
- **Do not restate the `make` targets.** `make help` prints them from the Makefile. New targets get
  a `## description` comment.
- **Link rather than summarise** when another page already owns the topic. If you must summarise,
  say which page is canonical, the way the site's credential-isolation page defers to
  `docs/credential-isolation-design.md`.
- **Do not document pull-request status.** Docs describe the current state of `main`; a merged PR
  leaves that prose silently stale.
- **Verify identifiers against source, not against other docs.** Service account names live in
  `k8s-operator/scripts/common.sh`, the Go version in `k8s-operator/go.mod`.
- **Add a document to the map (`docs/README.md`) with one line, and change nothing else there.**
  Write the row in the compact `| cell | cell |` form and never re-align a table: the map is edited
  from several branches every week, and a re-aligned table rewrites rows your PR did not author.
  `docs/README.md` §5 owns the rest of that contract — including why a file inside an existing
  family needs no map edit at all.

Run `make docs-check` before pushing. It verifies generated regions are current, relative links
resolve, identifiers match their source, and every Markdown document has an entry in the
documentation map (`docs/README.md`) — the same four checks CI runs.

## Pull Request Hygiene

- Keep changes scoped to the request.
- Do not commit unrelated formatting changes.
- Maintain the structure and intent of the agent configuration files.
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages.
- Push PR branches to a fork, not to the upstream repository.
- **Pin GitHub Actions to a full commit SHA.** Every third-party `uses:` in
  `.github/workflows/` must reference a 40-character commit SHA with the human-readable
  version in a trailing comment (`uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e… # v7.0.1`). Mutable tags
  (`@v4`, `@main`) are not permitted — a retagged release would silently change what CI runs.
  Local reusable workflows (`uses: ./.github/workflows/…`) are exempt. Dependabot updates the
  SHA and the comment together.
- Use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for PR body structure and level of
  detail. Do not use `--fill` with `gh pr create` as it bypasses the template.
- **Docs-drift review before opening a PR:** run the `review-docs-drift` skill
  (`.agents/skills/review-docs-drift/SKILL.md`) against your branch diff and address its
  Blocking findings. This is a required pre-PR step for AI agents working in this repository;
  `make docs-check` enforces only the mechanical subset (generated regions, links, terminology,
  map coverage), while the skill also verifies that doc prose still matches the source.
- **Live-test the change before opening a PR, and describe it in the PR body.** Every pull
  request fills in the template's **Testing → Live validation** section with how the change was
  exercised against a real, running kube-agents installation — see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) if
  you do not have one. Green unit tests and a clean `make docs-check` are necessary, not
  sufficient: they cannot tell you whether the operator reconciled the change or the agent pod
  picked it up. This bullet is the canonical statement of the requirement; the site's
  [contributing guide](docs/site/src/content/docs/contributing.md) and the comment in
  [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) summarise it — change
  this list first, then reconcile them to it.
  - **Name the install and what you observed.** Cluster, image tag, operator version; what you
    did; and the result at each layer the change claims to touch — the CR `.status`, the
    Deployment env, the file or process inside the pod.
  - **Prove the mechanism, not a coincidence.** If the new value happens to equal the old
    default, the observation proves nothing. Set something distinctly different, then revert and
    confirm it goes back.
  - **Say what you could not cover, and why**, rather than implying full coverage. Clean up test
    artifacts, restore prior state, and note anything left behind.
  - **If the change cannot reach a running installation** — docs-only, a CI workflow, a code path
    that needs infrastructure you do not have — write "Not live-tested" and say why. An empty
    section is not an answer.
- **Expect an automated review after opening a PR.** Opening the pull request starts
  `kube-agents-bot`; see
  [Automated Review After Opening a Pull Request](#automated-review-after-opening-a-pull-request)
  for what it does and what you are expected to do with its findings.
- **Leave no conversation unresolved.** `main` will not merge while a review thread is open, and
  the open thread also keeps the pull request counted as its author's outstanding work.
  Reply, then resolve every thread you are confident is addressed — commands and the bar for
  "confident" are in
  [Automated Review After Opening a Pull Request](#automated-review-after-opening-a-pull-request).
- **Local Validation Checks:** Before committing, try to run checks locally to avoid CI failures:
  - **Formatting:** Run `prettier --write <files>` on changed Markdown, JSON, or YAML files. You can check all files using `make prettier-check` (note: this checks files outside your PR scope; CI only checks the ones your branch changed). Install the version CI pins (see the Install Prettier step in `.github/workflows/prettier.yml`), e.g. `npm install -g prettier@<that version>` — the manifests gate in `k8s-operator-test.yml` asserts byte-equality against that version's output, so a skew fails CI on files you did not touch. Prefer the installed binary over `npx prettier`, which re-resolves the package against the npm registry on every run and fails outright behind an authenticated mirror — that failure is why this step has previously been skipped rather than run.
  - **Docker Build:** Validate the agent runner Dockerfile by building it locally (e.g., `docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile --target platform .`). Keep `--platform linux/amd64`: the base images are multi-arch and deployment targets are amd64 GKE nodes, so a bare build on an arm64 machine produces an image that cannot run on the cluster (#560).
  - **Image Layer Budget:** If you add a `RUN` or `COPY` to `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`, build the `credential-proxy` target with `-t credential-proxy:latest` and run `python3 scripts/check_image_layers.py`. Docker's overlay2 driver stops mounting at 128 layers and that chain is the longest in the file; because buildx has no such limit, an over-budget image passes every PR build and fails only in Cloud Build, on main, after merge (#658). CI runs the same check in `docker-build.yml`.
  - **Operator Code:** If you modify `k8s-operator/`, run `make` or `go build` inside that directory to ensure compilation succeeds.

## Automated Review After Opening a Pull Request

Every pull request here is reviewed automatically by `kube-agents-bot`, a GitHub App that runs a
coding agent over the branch diff. It only comments — it never pushes commits and never merges.
Opening a pull request is therefore not the end of the task. The bot introduces itself in a comment
on every pull request it picks up, and that comment states its current contract; if it disagrees
with what follows, believe the comment and fix this section.

**When it runs.** On `opened`, `reopened`, and draft-marked-ready. **Pushing more commits does not
start another review** — an active branch would otherwise pay for a re-read on every push. To get a
fresh review of the current commit, comment `/review` on a line of its own (repository owners,
members, and collaborators only) — that pass is the strict one, only what the bot is certain of,
while `/review all` re-reads at the width of the automatic first review and includes findings it
believes are real without being sure. The `agent:ignore` label opts a pull request out entirely and
outranks both.

**How to read it.** A 👀 reaction means the review started; a posted review means it finished.
Across #630–#699 the 👀 landed within seconds of the trigger, and the review a median of **9
minutes** after that — 15 minutes at the 90th percentile, 45 in the slowest of the 54 reviews in
that range (#634, an XXL diff). A `/review` re-read is no quicker: median 11 minutes, and none of
the 42 measured took longer than 22. A review that runs always reports back, so a one-line "no
findings" is a result, not silence. Findings arrive as inline comments badged 🔴 High, 🟠 Medium, or
🟡 Low; findings the bot could not anchor to a changed line appear in the summary body under
**Findings outside this diff**. A 👀 with nothing following it is a bug in the bot, not a verdict —
it happened to 3 of the 57 pull requests picked up in that range (#647, #649, #679), which is rare
enough to be worth waiting through and common enough that you must not wait forever.

**What agents must do.** After creating a pull request, tell the user the bot review is on its way
and **offer to wait for it** instead of reporting the work as finished. If the user accepts, poll on
a schedule rather than continuously — nothing is worth checking in the first 5 minutes, then once a
minute. Expect the review by 15 minutes; at 30 with nothing posted, stop waiting and tell the user
the bot dropped this one. Nothing retries on its own, so ask whether to spend a trigger — and say
which: the review that went missing was a first-review-width one, so `/review all` is what replaces
it, and `/review` narrows the retry to what the bot is certain of. Two things make a wait read
wrong:

- **The 👀 does not come back.** A reaction is one per user, so the eyes from the first review are
  still sitting there when you comment `/review` or mark a draft ready. Only the review list moves:
  note how many bot reviews exist _before_ you re-trigger, and wait for that count to change rather
  than for a reaction that already fired.
- **A draft is not waiting on anything.** The trigger is ready-for-review, not opened. Every
  multi-hour gap in the range above was a draft sitting unreviewed by design — #652 for 12 hours,
  #659 for 18 — and measured from the ready event each was picked up in seconds. Do not start the
  clock, or report the bot broken, while the pull request is still a draft.

Poll with:

```bash
# Both commands name gke-labs/kube-agents explicitly: PR branches live on forks,
# but the review lives on the upstream pull request.

# Has the bot reviewed yet? Takes the LAST bot review and prints its timestamp
# first: after a /review the earlier review is still there, and reading it back
# looks exactly like the new one having landed. No output = no review yet.
# (gh reports the login without the [bot] suffix; the REST API below adds it.)
gh pr view <number> --repo gke-labs/kube-agents --json reviews \
  --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.author.login == "kube-agents-bot")] | last | select(.)
        | "\(.submittedAt)\n\(.body)"'

# The inline findings, with the comment ids needed to reply. --paginate matters:
# the default page holds 30 comments and a truncated list still looks complete.
# .line is null once a finding's line falls out of the diff, hence the fallback.
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/pulls/<number>/comments --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "kube-agents-bot[bot]")
        | "\(.path):\(.line // .original_line) [id \(.id)]\n\(.body)\n"'
```

Then work the findings **with** the user rather than acting on them unilaterally: summarise each
one, say whether you think it should be fixed, pushed back on, or deferred, and let the user decide
before you change code. The bot is a reviewer, not an authority — but a finding you disagree with
gets answered in its thread, not silently dropped:

```bash
gh api repos/gke-labs/kube-agents/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
  -f body='<the reasoning>'
```

After pushing fixes, remember that the push alone does not re-trigger anything: ask the user whether
to comment `/review` for another pass — `/review` to confirm the fixes against a strict read,
`/review all` when the branch changed enough that it deserves a first-review-width look again. Then
wait for it the same way, counting reviews rather than watching for a second 👀.

**Then resolve the conversations.** `main` requires every conversation on a pull request to be
resolved before it can merge, and the triage sweep counts an open thread as work outstanding on the
author — so a branch whose fixes have all landed still sits blocked, and still shows up as the
author's problem rather than the reviewers'. Clearing the threads is part of finishing the change,
not a courtesy someone else will get to. Do it once the fixes are pushed and the last `/review` pass
has settled: a fresh review opens fresh threads, so resolving before it lands means doing it twice.

Resolve a thread — the bot's or a human's — when you are **fully confident the issue is addressed**:
the fix is on the pull request head and you can name the commit, or the finding is factually wrong
and you have said why. Check that second one against the merge target as it stands now, not against
your working copy — a finding that looks wrong because the file it cites does not say that is very
often a stale checkout rather than a wrong finding. Anything short of that stays open. A judgment call, a reviewer asking for
something you chose not to do, a rebuttal nobody has answered yet — reply and leave it to them.
Resolving says the conversation is finished; it is not a way to end a disagreement.

Reply first, always. A resolved thread collapses, so the reviewer who opened it may never expand it
again, and the reply is the only record of what happened. Name what changed and the commit that
changed it. Then resolve:

```bash
# Every unresolved thread, with both ids you need: resolveReviewThread takes the
# thread's node id, while the reply endpoint above takes the first comment's
# databaseId. REST returns only the latter, which is why this one is GraphQL.
gh api graphql -f query='
query($pr: Int!) {
  repository(owner: "gke-labs", name: "kube-agents") {
    pullRequest(number: $pr) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id isResolved isOutdated viewerCanResolve path line
          comments(first: 20) { nodes { databaseId author { login } body } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -F pr=<number> --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
  | select(.isResolved | not)
  | "\(.path):\(.line // "outdated") thread \(.id) canResolve=\(.viewerCanResolve)
  reply to \(.comments.nodes[0].databaseId) — \(.comments.nodes[0].author.login): \(.comments.nodes[0].body | split("\n")[0])
  replies so far: \(.comments.nodes | length - 1)"'

# Per thread, once the reply naming the fix is posted:
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($thread: ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $thread}) { thread { isResolved } }
}' -f thread='<PRRT_...>'
```

Four ways that goes wrong quietly:

- `first: 100` is a cap, not a promise. A long-lived pull request can carry more threads than that;
  page for the rest, or say you only looked at the first hundred rather than reporting the branch
  clear.
- `line` is `null` once a thread's line falls out of the diff. Outdated is not addressed — the code
  moved, which says nothing about whether the finding still holds. Read the thread.
- `viewerCanResolve` is the authoritative answer to whether your token can resolve at all; it
  differs between a maintainer and a contributor pushing from a fork. Check it before you reply,
  because a mutation that fails after the reply is posted leaves a half-answered thread that looks
  handled.
- `unresolveReviewThread`, same `threadId`, is the undo. Use it the moment the user disagrees with
  something you resolved.
