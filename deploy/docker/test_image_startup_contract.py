"""Contract tests for what the agent image guarantees about its own startup.

Run: python3 -m unittest discover -s deploy/docker -p 'test_*.py'

Three guarantees are pinned here, all invisible from any single source file:

  * the process the entrypoint execs starts inside the shared workspace, so the
    credential-proxy shims are not refused before they run;
  * the vendored Python tree carries a bytecode cache, since the runtime cannot
    build one; and
  * the event watcher's emergency stop reads the variable the operator writes,
    and reads it the way the CRD promises.

The entrypoint assertions run the real script rather than reading it. Every
step it takes is gated on an absolute image path (/opt/hermes, /opt/defaults)
that does not exist on a test machine, so it walks its guards and reaches the
exec with no image present — which makes the honest test available, and a
regex over the file the weaker substitute.
