"""Tell ``kanban_comment`` what the card it just wrote to is actually doing.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/tools/kanban_comment_status.py`` and
wired into ``tools/kanban_tools.py`` (the ``kanban_comment`` handler) by
``deploy/docker/patches/apply_kanban_comment_status.py``.

Why
---
On 2026-08-08 task ``t_a8f58a2a`` completed at 19:09:43 and its 6,191-character
report reached the user's Slack thread one second later. At 19:11:30 the front
door called ``kanban_comment`` on that same card and told the user "You'll see
the results post here as soon as the agent completes." The user waited 9m46s for
an answer that was already sitting above the question.

The comment call succeeded. It was unkeepable three ways over and upstream's
return value mentioned none of them:

1. **A comment does not respawn a card.** ``task_runs`` for ``t_a8f58a2a`` still
   held only run 97, and no new card was created between 19:11 and 19:24.
2. **The subscription was already gone.** ``gateway/kanban_watchers.py`` deletes
   a card's ``kanban_notify_subs`` rows on the tick that carries its terminal
   event (``task_terminal = task and task.status in {"done", "archived"}`` →
   ``_kanban_unsub``), so nothing could fire for that card again.
3. **Nobody ever re-read the comment.** Comments reach a worker two ways —
   ``build_worker_context`` folds them into the *next* worker's system prompt,
   and ``inject_new_comments_from_env`` (``run_agent.py``) steers them into a
   worker that is running right now. A ``done`` card has neither.

There is also a fourth thing that is true of *every* card, not just closed ones,
and is worth saying because it is the belief that produced the sentence:
**commenting never sends a chat message.** ``add_comment`` appends a
``commented`` event, and ``commented`` is not in the notifier's ``TERMINAL_KINDS``
(``completed, blocked, gave_up, crashed, timed_out, status, archived, unblocked,
block_loop_detected``). A comment can only reach a human by causing a worker to
run and *that* worker to complete.

What upstream returns is ``_ok(task_id=tid, comment_id=cid)`` —
``{"ok": true, "task_id": ..., "comment_id": ...}``. Read by a model that has
just written "here is the question, please answer in this thread", ``ok: true``
means the question was asked. It wasn't.

What this adds
--------------
Three fields, all additive; ``ok``, ``task_id`` and ``comment_id`` keep their
upstream meaning and shape because the model parses them.

``task_status``
    The card's raw ``tasks.status``. The single fact that makes the promise
    obviously wrong: you cannot read ``"task_status": "done"`` and still believe
    an answer is coming.

``comment_reaches``
    A sentence, not a token, because the token would need a legend the model
    does not have: who will read this comment. ``running`` cards are steered
    live, open cards wait for their next worker, terminal cards have neither.

``completion_posts_to_chat``
    Whether the card has a live ``kanban_notify_subs`` row — i.e. whether this
    card completing will post anything into a chat thread at all. This is the
    proposition the incident's sentence actually asserted, so it is worth
    answering directly. Emitted **only for non-terminal cards**; see below.

and, for terminal cards only, ``note``: an explicit instruction not to promise
delivery, plus where the answer already is.

Success, not an error
---------------------
Commenting on a closed card is a legitimate thing to do — annotating a finished
audit, recording an RCA note against a closed incident, leaving provenance on a
card someone will read on the dashboard. Refusing it would break that, and it
would break it in the direction this patch is least allowed to fail: an error
returns without writing, so the comment is *lost*. Losing a comment is a worse
outcome than the incident, which lost only a claim about a comment.

A refusal is also the wrong shape for the actual defect. The write was never the
problem; the write is fine and durable. The problem is that a bare ``ok: true``
licensed an inference — "asked, therefore an answer is coming" — that nothing in
the system supports. The fix is to make that inference unavailable, which a
returned status does and an error only does by accident, at the cost of also
destroying the legitimate call. So: always write, always report.

The one thing the return value must not do is read as pending, which is why the
terminal branch carries an imperative ``note`` rather than leaving the model to
infer the consequence of ``"done"`` on its own — inferring it is exactly what it
failed to do the first time.

Status outranks the subscription row
------------------------------------
``comment_reaches`` is derived from ``task_status`` alone, never from the
subscription count, and ``completion_posts_to_chat`` is withheld on terminal
cards. The two can disagree for one notifier tick: the unsub happens when the
notifier *processes* the terminal event, so a card that completed a second ago
is ``done`` with its rows still present. That window is precisely the incident's
window — 19:09:43 to 19:11:30 is well inside a five-second tick's blast radius
only if the tick stalls, but the ordering hazard is real and permanent. A model
handed ``"task_status": "done"`` next to ``"completion_posts_to_chat": true``
would resolve the contradiction in the optimistic direction, which is the bug.
So the racy field is simply not emitted where it could contradict the durable
one.

Fails toward upstream
---------------------
Every lookup here is wrapped. If ``get_task`` raises, if the row is missing, if
the board predates ``kanban_notify_subs``, :func:`delivery_fields` returns
``{}`` and the handler returns byte-for-byte what upstream returned. The comment
is already committed by the time this runs — ``add_comment`` opens and closes
its own ``write_txn`` — so there is no path on which reporting the status can
cost the caller the comment. Omitting a status field is a regression to previous
behaviour; failing the call would be a new way to lose data.

Cost
----
One extra ``SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE id = ?`` on the connection the handler
already holds open, against the primary key, plus one ``SELECT 1 FROM
kanban_notify_subs WHERE task_id = ? LIMIT 1`` served by ``idx_notify_task``.
The task row is *not* already loaded on this path — upstream's ``add_comment``
checks existence with its own ``SELECT 1`` inside ``write_txn`` and returns only
``lastrowid`` — so the status genuinely costs a query. Two indexed point lookups
against a local SQLite file, on a path that has just done a write transaction,
is not a cost worth trading a silent false promise for.
