"""Build-time behaviour gate for the cron-run scope patch.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against the patched ``/opt/hermes`` tree,
immediately after ``apply_cron_run_scope.py``. The applier proves the anchors
matched and the files still parse; this proves the patched code does what the
patch exists to do. A failure here fails the image build.

The unit suite in ``test_cron_run_scope.py`` covers ``cron_run_scope.py`` in
isolation. It cannot cover the in-place edits, because those live inside
Hermes' own modules — which is exactly where the first production regression
landed: ``save_job_output`` returns a ``pathlib.Path``, the run action
``json.dumps``es it, and the resulting ``TypeError`` replaced the entire tool
result with ``{"error": "Object of type PosixPath is not JSON serializable"}``.
The caller lost the run's report completely, which is worse than the bug the
patch set out to fix. So the checks below use a real ``Path`` and assert the
result actually serialises.
