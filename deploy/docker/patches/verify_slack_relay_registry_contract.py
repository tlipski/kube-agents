"""Build-time gate for the relay patches' grip on Hermes' platform registry.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` in the ``platform`` stage, against the real
``/opt/hermes`` tree and the scripts that will be on the runtime PYTHONPATH.
A failure here fails the image build.

The unit suite in ``agents/platform/scripts/test_slack_relay_patch.py`` covers
the shim against fakes, and fakes are written by the same hand as the shim.
That is not a hypothetical weakness. ``slack_relay_patch.install()`` replaces
``PlatformRegistry.register`` on the class, and until v2026.8.13 both the shim
and both test fakes declared ``register(self, entry)``. The base-image bump in
#718 gave upstream a keyword-only ``scope`` and had
``PluginContext.register_platform`` pass it on every registration. The fakes
agreed with the shim, CI was green, and the built image raised

    TypeError: register() got an unexpected keyword argument 'scope'

for *every* platform plugin -- Google Chat and Discord included, because the
shim sits on the class the whole gateway registers through. The gateway came up
with no chat adapters and nothing in the symptom pointed at a Slack file.

So this checks the shim against the thing it actually wraps:

1. the signatures and parameter defaults of every upstream callable the two
   patches replace or reimplement are still the signatures and defaults they
   were written against;
2. a plugin-sourced entry registers through the shim exactly as
   ``hermes_cli/plugins.py`` registers one, scope and all, and comes back
   relay-backed and findable;
3. a non-Slack entry registers untouched -- the blast radius, not the symptom;
4. the install-time sweep still finds an entry that was registered before the
   patch loaded, which since v2026.8.13 means finding it in ``_scoped_entries``
   rather than ``_entries``;
5. all of that again in a child process wired the way the pod is -- relay URL
   in the environment, scripts on ``PYTHONPATH`` -- so ``sitecustomize``'s
   import hook is what installs the patch, not this file.

Check 1 is a pin covering both callable signatures (`UPSTREAM_SIGNATURES`) and
critical parameter defaults (`PINNED_DEFAULTS`) on reimplemented methods. When
either fails, read the upstream method, decide whether the shim needs to change,
and then update the expectation deliberately -- do not refresh it to whatever
the new image says.

Checks 1-4 run in a process where ``SLACK_RELAY_URL`` is *unset at startup*,
because ``sitecustomize.install_hook()`` reads the environment as it is
imported: with the variable set, the hook is armed before this file gets a
word in and ``PlatformRegistry.register`` is already wrapped by the time the
signatures are read, which would pin the shim against itself. The wired
process is check 5's job, and it asserts the hook fired rather than installing
anything by hand.
