"""Everything the kanban notifier does with a card's terminal event.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/kanban_notifier.py`` and
wired into ``gateway/kanban_watchers.py`` by
``deploy/docker/patches/apply_kanban_notifier.py``.

One module because it is one code path. When a card reaches a terminal state
the notifier builds a chat line, sends it, and then decides whether to spend a
model turn waking the agent that created the card. Three separate patches used
to rewrite that path — a clip, a result delivery, and a wake filter — each with
its own applier anchored into the same function, each its own way for a
base-image bump to break the build for a reason that has nothing to do with the
other two. They are merged here: two anchors, one applier, one verifier.

The three concerns, in the order the notifier reaches them:

1. **Clip** the status line. ``clip_handoff`` is re-exported from
   ``gateway/kanban_handoff_clip.py``, which stays a module of its own because
   ``tools/cron_run_scope.py`` imports it too and needs it earlier in the
   build. The *wiring* of it into the notifier lives here.
2. **Deliver** the report: :func:`handoff_with_result` puts the card's
   ``result`` into the message the notifier already builds, and
   :func:`unstructured_result` records in the log when that report will render
   flat in Slack for want of Markdown structure. The note changes nothing about
   what is sent — it exists because a flattened report raises no error to see.
3. **Wake**, or not: :func:`wake_kinds_for` decides which terminal kinds are
   worth a model turn now that steps 1 and 2 have made the message carry the
   answer.
4. **Record** what step 3 chose not to announce:
   :func:`note_suppressed_completion` writes a one-shot marker into the
   creator's session state so the *next* turn knows the card finished, without
   spending a turn to find out.

Step 3 is only defensible because steps 1 and 2 happened, which is the clearest
argument for keeping them together: ``kanban.wake_on_events`` may drop
``completed`` on the grounds that the answer is already in the thread, and it is
this module that put it there. Step 4 is the other half of that bargain — the
answer being in the thread is a fact about the *user's* screen, not about the
agent's transcript, and step 3 is only safe once something has told the agent.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Delivering the card's ``result`` into the chat that asked for it
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The companion patch ``tools/kanban_result_required.py`` makes sure a card
# closes with its answer in ``result``. That makes the answer *durable* — it is
# on the card and ``kanban_show`` returns it whole. It does not make it
# *arrive*, because nothing upstream posts ``result`` to chat.
#
# The chat line for a completed card is built from ``ev.payload["summary"]``,
# which the kernel writes as (``hermes_cli/kanban_db.py``)::
#
#     ev_summary = (summary if summary is not None else result) or ""
#     ev_summary = ev_summary.strip().splitlines()[0][:400] if ev_summary else ""
#
# One line, 400 characters. The summary channel is therefore not merely the
# wrong place for a report — it is structurally incapable of carrying one. A
# worker that does exactly what the schema now asks (status line in ``summary``,
# the deliverable in ``result``) would still send a chat message announcing a
# catalogue it never shows.
#
# This section supplies the missing text. It goes into **the completion message
# the notifier already builds**, rather than a second message, and that is
# deliberate: the existing send site is wrapped in the notifier's failure
# counter, cursor rewind, and subscription-drop logic
# (``gateway/kanban_watchers.py``). One message inherits all of it. A follow-up
# ``adapter.send()`` would sit outside that machinery, after the cursor has
# advanced, and would need its own — a second failure path guarding the payload
# that matters most.
#
# The notifier's own clip gives way
# ---------------------------------
# :func:`handoff_with_result` replaces the notifier's ``handoff`` rather than
# appending to it, and it has to. Where the completion event carries no
# ``summary``, ``kanban_watchers.py`` builds the status line out of the very
# field this code exists to deliver::
#
#     elif task and task.result:
#         r = _clip_handoff(task.result)
#         handoff = f"\n{r}"
#
# ``delivered`` is then a 1200-character clip of ``result``, so asking whether
# ``result`` already appears inside it — the containment test
# :func:`result_block` does — is asking whether a report fits inside its own
# prefix. Under ``kanban_handoff_clip.DEFAULT_LIMIT`` it does, and the block
# correctly stays empty. Over it, it never does: the message went out carrying
# the first 1200 characters of the report, the ``[…]`` marker, a blank line,
# and then the same report over again from the top. Measured on a 60-line cron
# catalogue, jobs 1 to 19 arrived twice. Every result long enough to need this
# code at all was delivered doubled, because ``RESULT_LIMIT`` is 30000 precisely
# for reports that outgrow a status line.
#
# Appending cannot fix that — only the caller of the clip can decide the clip
# was a mistake — so the hook returns the finished tail instead. When the status
# line is merely a clipped prefix of the report, it is dropped and the report is
# sent once, whole. That branch got *more* reachable, not less, when
# ``tools/kanban_result_required.py`` began folding a whitespace-only
# ``summary`` to ``None`` to stop ``complete_task`` indexing line zero of a
# blank string and wedging the card.
#
# Length is safe on both platforms this harness ships to. The notifier calls
# ``adapter.send()`` directly, and ``send()`` chunks: the Slack adapter declares
# ``splits_long_messages = True`` with ``MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH = 39000`` and splits
# on code-block boundaries; the bundled ``google_chat`` adapter chunks at 4000.
# ``RESULT_LIMIT`` is well inside the smaller of those headrooms once the status
# line and title are accounted for, and exists to bound a worker that dumps a
# log rather than to fit a single message.

#: How much of ``result`` reaches chat. The status line's own budget is 1200
#: (``kanban_handoff_clip.DEFAULT_LIMIT``) because it is a status line; this is
#: the report and needs room. Sized far above the ~5.5 KB catalogue that card
#: t_8d1cf5cf should have delivered, and far enough below the 39000-character
#: Slack ceiling that the status line, the title, and the clip marker all fit
#: alongside it.
RESULT_LIMIT = 30000

# 3. Making the agent wake configurable
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When a card reaches a terminal state the notifier does two separate things
# for the same event:
#
# 1. ``adapter.send(...)`` posts the completion line — the worker's own summary,
#    plus whatever :func:`handoff_with_result` added to it — straight into the
#    originating chat thread. The user has the answer at this point.
# 2. ``adapter.handle_message(...)`` then injects a synthetic ``MessageEvent``
#    to *wake the agent that created the card*, which costs a full model turn.
#
# Upstream hardcodes which event kinds trigger step 2::
#
#     _WAKE_KINDS = ("completed", "gave_up", "crashed", "timed_out", "blocked")
#
# There is no config key for it anywhere in Hermes. For the Chat Agent front
# door that makes ``completed`` pure overhead: the summary has already been
# delivered, so the woken turn re-reads the card with ``kanban_show`` and
# paraphrases a message the user is already looking at. Measured on task
# ``t_c31a1f00`` (2026-08-05): **5.9 s and 32,460 input tokens** for that third
# hop, on a request whose actual work was a single 477 ms ``list_clusters``
# call.
#
# The failure kinds are a different matter. ``gave_up`` / ``crashed`` /
# ``timed_out`` / ``blocked`` produce a terse status line and nothing else, and
# the front door genuinely should react — retry, escalate, or tell the user what
# broke. So this is not "turn the wake off", it is "wake for the events that
# need a decision, not for the one that already answered itself".
#
# :func:`resolve_wake_kinds` reads ``kanban.wake_on_events`` from config and
# falls back to the upstream tuple, so an image built without that key set
# behaves exactly as upstream does.
#
# All of that reasoning is conditional on step 1 having happened, which is why
# :func:`wake_kinds_for` takes the adapter and leaves a non-push one alone:
# where the notifier skips the send, the wake is not a third hop over a
# delivered answer, it is the only delivery there is.

#: The upstream hardcoded set, and the fallback for any config that does not

    never announced to anyone; upstream added that self-post to fix the
    api_server wrong-session bug, and dropping ``completed`` re-breaks it.

# 4. Recording the completion the wake no longer announces
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Section 3 saves a model turn by not waking the creator for ``completed``. The
# saving is real and this section does not give it back. What section 3 did not
# account for is that the wake was doing two jobs at once, and only one of them
# was redundant:
#
# * it *told the user* — redundant, because ``adapter.send()`` already put the
#   whole report in the thread;
# * it *told the agent* — not redundant at all, because the synthetic
#   ``MessageEvent`` was the only thing that ever entered the creator's
#   transcript to say the card had finished.
#
# Dropping the wake dropped both. The creator's session is left with
# ``kanban_create → subscribed: true`` as the last thing it knows, and no event
# of any kind afterwards, so on its next turn the front door does not conclude
# "the card is done" — it concludes "the card is still running", because that
# is what its context says.
#
# Observed end to end on task ``t_a8f58a2a`` (2026-08-08):
#
#   19:08:01  front door files the card, subscribed: true
#   19:09:43  worker completes; 6,191-character report
#   19:09:44  notifier delivers the report to the Slack thread — succeeded
#   19:11:30  user follows up. The front door calls ``kanban_comment`` (not
#             ``kanban_show``) and promises "You'll see the results post here
#             as soon as the agent completes". They had posted 106 s earlier.
#   19:20:59  user asks whether it is still running
#   19:21:12  front door finally calls ``kanban_show``, sees ``done``, pastes
#             the answer it had had all along.
#
# Nine minutes forty-six seconds of dead wait, caused by an absence rather than
# an error — which is why nothing in the logs or the card looked wrong.
#
# The marker, and why it is free
# ------------------------------
# The gateway already has a channel for exactly this: per-turn "must-deliver
# notes". ``GatewayRunner._set_pending_turn_sidecar_notes(session_key, notes)``
# parks strings on ``SessionState.conversation.sidecar_notes``; the next turn's
# agent setup drains them into ``agent._gateway_turn_context_notes``
# (``gateway/run.py``), and ``agent/turn_context.py`` appends them to *that
# turn's user message* through the ``api_content`` sidecar. Upstream uses it for
# the auto-reset notice, the first-contact intro, and Discord voice-channel
# changes.
#
# It is the right channel here for three reasons:
#
# 1. **It costs no turn.** The note is not delivered *to* the model, it is
#    waiting *for* the model, and it rides a user message that was going to be
#    sent anyway. Where the wake cost 5.9 s and 32,460 input tokens (task
#    ``t_c31a1f00``), this costs about seventy tokens on one turn.
# 2. **It is one-shot.** ``_consume_pending_turn_sidecar_notes`` clears the
#    list as it reads it, and ``consume_gateway_turn_context_notes`` clears the
#    agent-side copy again, so a completion is announced to the agent exactly
#    once and never replays out of a cached agent.
# 3. **It rides the user message, not the system prompt.** Upstream moved these
#    notes off the ephemeral system prompt deliberately: a note in the system
#    prompt guarantees a turn-1/turn-2 prompt diff, which forces a full agent
#    rebuild and re-keys the prompt cache. Writing the marker into
#    ``ConversationState.ephemeral_pin`` — the other per-session string that
#    reaches the model — would therefore have cost *more* than the wake it is
#    saving, on top of being a cache slot that the next key miss overwrites.
#
# Not the transcript
# ------------------
# ``session_store.append_to_transcript`` would be durable across a gateway
# restart, which the marker is not. It was rejected anyway: a transcript row is
# replayed on *every* later turn rather than one, it inserts a message with no
# matching assistant turn into a history other code assumes alternates, and it
# is a SQLite write on the notifier's poll loop. Durability is not worth those;
# a marker lost to a restart just restores today's behaviour.
#
# Independent of the subscription
# -------------------------------
# The note has to outlive the thing that triggered it. On a terminal event the
# notifier calls ``self._kanban_unsub(sub, board_slug)`` and the subscription
# row is deleted from the kanban database moments later. The marker never
# touches that row: it lives in the gateway's in-memory
# ``SessionState.conversation`` for a session key resolved from the session
# store. Unsubscribing cannot reach it.
#
# Which completions get one
# -------------------------
# Exactly the ones the narrowing suppressed: the terminal kinds upstream would
# have woken for, minus the ones this delivery is waking for. A kind that still
# wakes needs no marker (the wake enters the transcript itself), and a gateway
# with ``kanban.wake_on_events`` unset suppresses nothing, so it writes no notes
# and behaves exactly as before. That makes the existing config key the on
# switch and means this section needs no key of its own.

#: Opening of every note this module writes. Doubles as the marker that tells
#: :func:`stage_note` which of a session's staged notes are ours, so trimming
#: to :data:`MAX_NOTES` can never evict upstream's auto-reset notice or
#: first-contact intro.
