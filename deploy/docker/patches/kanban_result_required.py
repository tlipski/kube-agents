"""Make ``result`` the single field that carries a completed card's answer.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/tools/kanban_result_required.py`` and
wired into ``tools/kanban_tools.py`` by
``deploy/docker/patches/apply_kanban_result_required.py``.

The companion patch ``gateway/kanban_notifier.py`` posts ``result`` into the
chat thread. This one makes sure there is something in it to post.

Why
---
On 2026-08-07 a user asked which platform cron jobs were enabled. Three cards
ran (``t_8d1cf5cf``, ``t_97f721b6``, ``t_68fbd0b6``); all three closed ``done``;
the user never got the list. Dumping the board afterwards showed
``tasks.result IS NULL`` and ``result_len: 0`` on every one of them. The workers
had built the catalogue — it is still sitting in
``/opt/data/kanban/logs/t_8d1cf5cf.log``, 5.5 KB of it — printed it to their own
stdout, and then dropped it on the floor at the ``kanban_complete`` call.

They were doing what they were told. Upstream's own tool schema describes
``result`` as::

    Short result log line (legacy field, maps to task.result). Use ``summary``
    instead when possible; this exists for compatibility with callers that
    still set --result on the CLI.

and ``summary`` as "Human-readable handoff, 1-3 sentences", while the gate below
it accepts ``summary or result``. So the model is told the only field that can
carry a report is legacy, told to prefer a field documented as 1-3 sentences,
and then allowed to close the card with just that. A worker holding a 5.5 KB
answer follows the schema and throws it away.

Worse, ``summary`` cannot carry a report even if a worker tries: the kernel
writes the completion event as (``hermes_cli/kanban_db.py``)::

    ev_summary = (summary if summary is not None else result) or ""
    ev_summary = ev_summary.strip().splitlines()[0][:400] if ev_summary else ""

First line only, 400 characters, no ellipsis. The chat notifier reads that field
and nothing else, so a multi-line summary loses everything after line one
silently.

What this changes
-----------------
Two things, both deterministic — there is no attempt to classify a card as
"asked for information" or not. Every card has an answer, even if the answer is
one line ("Restarted the deployment; 3/3 pods ready"), so every card is
required to carry one.

1. **Schema wording.** ``result`` becomes the required field that carries the
   deliverable and says it is posted to the requester verbatim; ``summary``
   becomes an explicitly one-line, 400-character status header. A prompt that
   prevents the mistake is worth more than a gate that rejects it.

2. **The gate.** Upstream's ``if not (summary or result)`` becomes a check that
   ``result`` carries something.

3. **No shape check.** One lived here from 2026-08-08 to 2026-08-11: a
   ``result`` that opened sections with ``#``, or marked them with
   ``=== Title ===`` and no real Markdown, was refused with the edit to make.
   It was removed because it could lose a report, and because measuring it
   showed it was not buying enough to be worth that.

   The refusal returned before ``kb.complete_task``, so a refused completion
   wrote nothing at all: the card stayed open, no result was stored, and the
   only copy of the report was in the worker's context. Usually the worker
   reformats and the retry lands. When the run ended in between — a turn limit,
   a cancellation, a cron child exiting — the report was gone and the card was
   left open with nothing on it.

   Set against that, what the check enforced was one nudge, not a shape. The
   retry skipped it entirely, so a worker that resubmitted the same badly
   formatted text unchanged was accepted. It could cost a complete report; it
   could not promise a well-formed one. For a stack whose whole premise is that
   the report reaching the requester's thread *is* the deliverable, that trade
   does not survive.

   The contract is still stated where stating it is free: the report-format
   stanza stapled to the card body at ``kanban_create``, and the schema wording
   in point 1 — a prompt that prevents the mistake is worth more than a gate
   that rejects it. ``tools/kanban_report_format.py`` still owns the defect
   list, and ``gateway/kanban_notifier.py`` records the shape it delivered so a
   badly formatted report is visible afterwards rather than refused in advance.

Never wedging the card
----------------------
A gate that can refuse forever is a worse bug than the one it fixes, so a
refusal is never repeated back to back. The first content-free completion is
rejected with an instruction; the retry is accepted even when it is content-free
again, promoting ``summary`` into ``result`` so the card still carries the best
text available. One nudge is what a model needs to correct a tool call, and the
card reaches ``done`` on its second attempt either way.

Remembering the refusal, and forgetting it
------------------------------------------
"The retry" only means anything if the handler remembers refusing this card, and
that memory has to expire. It first did not: ``_nudged`` was a module-level
``set`` that only ever grew, so a task id in it meant "accept this completion,
whatever it contains" for the life of the process.

On the worker path that was harmless by accident. ``dispatch_in_gateway`` moves
the *dispatcher loop* into the gateway, not the worker —
``gateway/kanban_watchers.py``'s ``_kanban_dispatcher_watcher`` calls
``kanban_db.dispatch_once`` with no ``spawn_fn``, so ``_default_spawn`` still
``subprocess.Popen``s ``hermes -p <profile> chat -q "work kanban task t_…"``.
One process per dispatch means the set holds one id and dies with the attempt
that created it.

It was not harmless in the gateway. ``toolsets: [kanban]`` is set on the
``platform`` profile and on the pod's root config, and
``_enforce_worker_task_ownership`` deliberately exempts a caller with no
``HERMES_KANBAN_TASK`` in its environment, because an orchestrator "sometimes
legitimately close[s] out child tasks". So a gateway session can complete any
card from a process that lives as long as the pod, and the first content-free
completion of a card spent that card's nudge permanently: every later attempt,
including one made hours afterwards on a card that had been reopened and
retried, was accepted in silence. That is the 2026-08-07 incident, reintroduced
by the code written to fix it.

The memory is therefore ``_refused_at``, task id to ``time.monotonic()``, read
by popping: a refusal older than ``NUDGE_TTL_SECONDS`` belongs to a different
attempt and the new attempt gets its own nudge. Expiry does not reopen the
wedge, because any caller that retries promptly — the only kind that ever
completes anything — is still inside the window on its second call.

Blank is empty, all the way down
--------------------------------
``result="   "`` used to reach the board. The gate reads it as empty, but the
promotion branch then handed the whitespace back as the value to store, and the
two lines quoted above run inside ``complete_task``'s ``write_txn``. ``"   "`` is
truthy, ``"   ".strip().splitlines()`` is ``[]``, and ``[0]`` raises
``IndexError`` with the ``UPDATE … SET status = 'done'`` already executed. The
transaction rolls back, the handler's blanket ``except Exception`` turns the
failure into ``kanban_complete: list index out of range``, and the card is still
``running`` — with its nudge already spent, so the identical retry takes the
identical path. That card never closes and its worker is never told why.

The expression reads ``summary`` first, so a blank ``summary`` wedges a card the
same way however good its ``result`` is; upstream's ``if not (summary or
result)`` never caught that either. Both fields are folded to ``None`` by
:func:`blank_to_none` before they leave here — ``None`` is the value
``complete_task`` is written to handle, and a field holding only whitespace is
not carrying anything anyway.

Scope: the gate lives in the ``kanban_complete`` tool handler. The CLI and the
scheduler write through ``kb.complete_task`` directly and are unaffected, so no
cron run and no human at a shell can be blocked by it. Every caller that does go
through the handler — a dispatched worker closing its own card, an orchestrator
gateway session closing somebody else's — is gated, which is why the refusal
memory has to be correct for a process that outlives a single card.
