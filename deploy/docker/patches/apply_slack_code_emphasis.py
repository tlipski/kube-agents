"""Let bold and italic survive an inline code span in Slack Block Kit output.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against the Hermes tree at
``plugins/platforms/slack/block_kit.py``.

The bug
-------
``_inline_elements`` turns a run of markdown into ``rich_text`` children — the
elements Slack uses for list items, block quotes and table cells. It tokenized
inline code first and *by splitting the run on it*::

    for m in _INLINE_CODE_RE.finditer(s):
        _walk_links(s[pos:m.start()], style)   # the gap BEFORE the code span
        emit_text(m.group(1), {"code": True})
        pos = m.end()
    _walk_links(s[pos:], style)                # the gap AFTER it

Each gap reaches the emphasis scan as its own string, so a ``**`` that opens
before a code span and closes after it can never pair up: ``_BOLD_RE`` sees
``"**"`` in one call and ``"** (us-east4) …"`` in the next, matches neither, and
``_walk_emphasis`` falls through to ``emit_text(s, …)``, which emits the
delimiters verbatim. The docstring's promise that "unmatched markup is emitted
verbatim … so this never loses characters" is what turns a parse miss into
literal asterisks on screen.

Two standard-Markdown spellings render wrongly as a result:

``**`code`**`` (emphasis wrapping a code span)
    Renders as a literal ``**``, a code chip, then a literal ``**``.

``**bold with `code` inside**`` (a code span inside an emphasis run)
    Renders as literal ``**bold with``, a code chip, then ``inside**``. Nothing
    is bold, because the only place code is detected is the top-level ``walk``
    and ``_walk_emphasis`` never recurses back into it.

Measured on card ``t_549d081c`` (a fleet health check that fanned out to four
Cluster Agents on 2026-08-12). Its ``result`` opened each list item with
``**`adam-new-cluster`** (us-east4) -> …`` and Slack showed the asterisks:
``{"type": "text", "text": "**"}``, ``{"text": "adam-new-cluster", "style":
{"code": true}}``, ``{"type": "text", "text": "** (us-east4) -> …"}``.

Only the ``rich_text`` path is affected. Section blocks go through the adapter's
``format_message`` (``render_blocks(content, mrkdwn_fn=self.format_message)``),
which protects inline code behind placeholders *before* converting ``**x**`` to
``*x*``, so the same markdown in a paragraph has always rendered correctly. That
asymmetry is why this reads as a formatting bug rather than a broken agent: the
identical source renders one way in a paragraph and another in a list item.

The agents cannot route around it. ``agents/platform/SOUL.md`` §0 tells every
worker to "write standard Markdown and not Slack's own mrkdwn — ``**bold**``,
not ``*bold*`` — because the adapter converts for you". ``**`code`**`` is
standard Markdown, and backticked identifiers are required by the report-format
stanza in ``kanban_report_format.py``, so the two rules together steer workers
straight into this case.

The fix
-------
Mask instead of split. Each inline code span is replaced by a ``\\x00N\\x00``
sentinel and held in a list; links and emphasis then scan one continuous string,
and ``emit_text`` restores the spans as it emits, giving each the style of the
run it sits in. Code stays opaque either way — no markdown is interpreted inside
a span, which was the point of tokenizing it first — but the emphasis scan is no
longer handed a pre-chopped string it cannot match across.

A restored span carries a combined style, ``{"bold": true, "code": true}``,
which is what Slack's own composer emits for bolded code and what the upstream
``code_style = dict(style)`` line was already written to allow — that ``dict``
copy could only ever be empty before this change, because ``walk`` ran only at
the top level with ``{}``.

``_unmask`` handles the one place a code element cannot go: a Slack ``link``
element carries flat ``text``/``url`` strings with no children, so a sentinel
landing there is restored to its original backticked source instead. That also
repairs ``[`code`](url)``, which upstream shredded into three elements because
the code split ran before the link scan.

Handing the emphasis scan one continuous string also un-hides a second defect,
which the split had been suppressing by accident. ``_ITALIC_RE`` has no
intra-word rule — it rejects a delimiter only when it sits next to whitespace or
another ``*``/``_`` — so a bare ``_`` inside a snake_case token opens emphasis.
While each gap was scanned alone a lone underscore usually had nothing to pair
with; across a mask, the ``_`` in ``t_549d081c`` pairs with the one in
``machine_type``, italicising everything between them, swallowing the code chip,
and *deleting* both delimiters. That is a worse failure than the one being fixed
here: literal asterisks are ugly but lossless, whereas this silently corrupts the
card IDs and machine types these reports exist to carry. ``_BOLD_RE``'s ``__``
alternative has the same shape.

So underscore runs that cannot be one half of a real emphasis pair are masked
too, as ``\\x01``, and restored when the element is emitted. Masking is used
rather than tightening ``_ITALIC_RE`` and ``_BOLD_RE`` directly because guarding
only their ``_`` alternatives means splitting each into separately-anchored
branches, which renumbers the capture group ``_walk_emphasis`` reads as
``m.group(1)``. The guard incidentally repairs the same-gap case (two snake_case
tokens with no span between them), which upstream mangles today.

Which runs to mask is decided by pairing them, not by looking at either run's
neighbours alone — that distinction is load-bearing, and review of two earlier
revisions proved it the hard way. A neighbour rule that masks only
alphanumeric-flanked runs leaves ``🚀_x``/``/tmp/_a``-shaped runs free to pair
across the message (review finding #2). Widening either side of the rule then
masks one half of legitimate emphasis and leaves the other half stranded — and
a stranded delimiter does not render harmlessly, it pairs with the *next*
stranded delimiter: mask the quote-adjacent openers in ``"_a_" and "_b_"`` and
the two orphaned closers italicise ``" and "``, deleting characters that both
upstream and the narrower guard rendered fine. Every one-sided mask just moves
the corruption to a different shape of text.

``_mask_underscores`` therefore classifies each run — can it open, can it
close, per CommonMark-style flanking (``_`` never opens or closes against an
alphanumeric on both sides) — pairs openers with closers on a stack, and masks
every run left unpaired. Two invariants fall out. Masked runs are restored
verbatim on emit, so a wrong *mask* decision shows a literal underscore and
never deletes; and every surviving run sits in a plausible open→close pair, so
the emphasis regexes downstream cannot be handed a stranded delimiter.

Deliberately asymmetric: intra-word ``*`` is *not* masked. CommonMark forbids
intra-word ``_`` emphasis and permits intra-word ``*``, upstream already
italicises ``cp a*b c*d`` with no code span involved, and masking ``*`` here
would break legitimate ``a**b**c``. So ``*`` keeps pairing across a masked span,
which makes the code-span case agree with the no-span case, and the two-wildcard
selector ``app=*,tier=*`` still loses its stars in both — pinned in
``test_slack_code_emphasis.py`` so the asymmetry is on the record.

Upstream: not reported. The renderer is Hermes-internal and this directory is
the repository's normal route for a Hermes fix.
