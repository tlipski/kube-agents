"""Make a dispatched cron run report back, and stop it closing its caller's card.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/tools/cron_run_scope.py`` and wired
into ``cron/scheduler.py``, ``tools/cronjob_tools.py``, and
``tools/kanban_tools.py`` by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile``.

Two upstream defects combine badly when an orchestrator profile dispatches a
cron job with ``cronjob(action='run')``. Both were observed in production on
2026-08-04, when three of the five fleet-audit streams published wrong results
— including a ledger issue closed as "no issues found" that had real findings,
and a second ledger issue opened and closed with eight-hour-stale data.

1. **The run's result is discarded.** ``cron/scheduler.py:run_job`` returns
   ``(success, output, final_response, error)``, but ``run_one_job`` throws
   ``final_response`` away and returns a bare ``bool``. The caller blocked for
   nearly five minutes and got back only ``{"executed": true,
   "execution_success": true, ...}`` — no report, no issue URL, not even the
   path of the saved output file. It had no way to see that the run had
   already published its result.

2. **The run terminates the dispatcher's kanban card.** A dispatched job runs
   in-process inside the kanban worker and inherits ``HERMES_KANBAN_TASK``.
   Every cron session called ``kanban_complete`` with no ``task_id``, and
   ``_default_task_id`` resolved it from the env to the *caller's* card. Each
   dispatcher then got ``could not complete t_… (unknown id or already
   terminal)`` and its own summary was silently dropped on the floor.

Together they leave a dispatcher with a finished-but-invisible run and a dead
card, which is what drove three of them to improvise: re-running the audit's
publish step against shared scratch state, restoring a stale findings file from
a ``.bak``, and finally hand-blanking it to force the issue closed.

The fix is a marker, ``HERMES_KANBAN_CRON_RUN``, held for the duration of a
dispatched run in a ``contextvars.ContextVar``. It says "this run is a cron job
borrowing a worker's environment", which is precisely the distinction the kanban
helpers could not previously draw. Defect 1 is fixed separately, by an
``outcome`` out-param that lets ``run_one_job`` hand its ``final_response`` back
instead of dropping it.

Why the scope does not also set an environment variable
-------------------------------------------------------
It used to, in imitation of ``gateway/session_context.py``'s cron auto-delivery
pair, on the argument that a cron agent shelling out to ``hermes kanban …``
should inherit the marker. That argument bought a hypothesis — nothing in this
image reads the marker from a subprocess; every reader
(``tools/kanban_tools.py``'s three call sites and
``hermes_cli/kanban_guardrail_exit.py``) is in-process — and paid for it three
times over, because an environment variable is process-global and a cron run is
not:

* **It leaked permanently.** Two *overlapping* runs — A in, B in, A out, B out —
  restore in the wrong order: A pops the variable it never found, then B puts
  A's marker back with no run active at all. From then on every worker in the
  process is told it is a run of job A, so ``kanban_complete`` with no
  ``task_id`` is refused, naming the explicit id is refused by
  ``_enforce_worker_task_ownership``, and the guardrail backstop is suppressed
  as well. The card sits ``running`` with no result and no failure, forever.
  Two parallel ``cronjob(action='run')`` calls in one assistant turn reach this;
  ``agent/tool_executor.py`` runs tool calls on a pool and ``cronjob`` is not on
  its serial list.
* **It bled across threads.** Any thread that never entered the scope still read
  the marker through the fallback, so under ``dispatch_in_gateway`` an unrelated
  worker running concurrently with somebody else's dispatch answered
  ``current_cron_job() == '<their job>'``.
* **It was inherited by spawned workers.** ``hermes_cli/kanban_db.py``'s spawn
  copies ``os.environ`` and scrubs only the ``HERMES_KANBAN_*`` keys
  ``gateway/session_context.py`` lists. This marker is not among them, so a
  worker spawned during a run carried it for life.

A ContextVar has none of those failure modes and needs no save/restore: it is
scoped to the thread ``run_job`` submitted the run on, ``copy_context()`` carries
it to ``run_conversation``, and ``reset(token)`` is exact under any interleaving.
``current_cron_job`` still *reads* ``os.environ`` as a fallback, so if the fork
case ever becomes real the marker can be stamped onto that child's environment
deliberately — the way ``agent/delegation_context.py`` stamps its own — rather
than onto the whole process.

``HERMES_KANBAN_TASK`` is deliberately left in place rather than unset for the
duration. ``kanban_tools.heartbeat_current_worker_from_env()`` reads it on
every call to keep the dispatcher's 15-minute claim alive, and a compliance
audit takes about 20 minutes — stripping it would let the claim lapse mid-run
and hand the card to a second worker.
