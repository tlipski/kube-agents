"""Unit tests for the kanban notifier patch installed by deploy/docker/Dockerfile.

Merges what were ``test_kanban_wake_kinds.py`` and ``test_kanban_result_delivery.py``,
and adds :class:`LegacyEquivalenceTest`, which pins the claim the merge rests on:
one applier with two anchors produces the same patched source as the three it
replaced. ``test_kanban_handoff_clip.py`` stays separate — it tests the shared
text utility, which has no anchor into upstream source.
