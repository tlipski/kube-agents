"""Wire tools/cron_run_scope.py into the Hermes source tree.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` against ``/opt/hermes``. Nine anchored
string replacements across three files is past the point where an inline
``python3 -c`` stays readable, so the edits live here — but the guarantee is
the same as the other patches in the Dockerfile: every anchor must be found
the exact number of times expected, every edited file must still parse, and
anything else fails the build loudly rather than shipping a half-patched image.

Why each edit is needed is documented in the module docstring of
``deploy/docker/patches/cron_run_scope.py``. Usage::

    python3 apply_cron_run_scope.py [HERMES_ROOT]   # default /opt/hermes
