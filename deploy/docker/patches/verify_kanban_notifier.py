"""Build gate for the kanban notifier patch.

Run by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` from ``/opt/hermes`` after the applier. It
replaces ``verify_kanban_wake_kinds.py`` and the delivery half of
``verify_kanban_result.py`` (whose remaining sections still gate
``tools/kanban_result_required.py``, a different patch against a different
file), and it additionally covers the clip wiring, which previously had nothing
behind it but two ``grep -q``\\ s in the Dockerfile.

The applier only proves its two anchors matched, and a matched anchor is the
weaker half of all four concerns here:

* **Clip.** A textual grep proves ``_clip_handoff`` is called; it does not prove
  the name resolves at runtime, and the whole patch exists because a URL arrived
  severed. So the clip is driven, not read.
* **Delivery.** The regression that motivated it was not a failed edit — it was
  a field the model was told not to use — and the follow-on regression was a
  hook that appended where it had to replace. Both are behavioural.
* **Wake.** Every failure mode that costs anything is silent by construction:
  ``resolve_wake_kinds`` fails *towards* upstream, so a ``hermes_cli.config``
  that moved, a ``gateway.wake`` that moved, or a ``DEFAULT_WAKE_KINDS``
  whitelist that fell behind the notifier all present identically to "the
  operator never set ``kanban.wake_on_events``". The symptom is not an
  exception, it is the 5.9 s / 32,460-token redundant turn from task
  ``t_c31a1f00`` quietly coming back.
* **Marker.** Worse again, because it writes into gateway session state that
  nothing else in the build reads back. A note parked on a session *id* instead
  of a session key, a store that dropped ``lookup_by_session_id``, a ``run.py``
  that stopped draining ``sidecar_notes`` — each is a silent no-op producing
  precisely what the unpatched gateway produced, which is the 9m46s of dead wait
  on task ``t_a8f58a2a``.

So this drives the *patched* runtime rather than reading it: the real
``hermes_cli.config.load_config``, the real ``gateway.wake.adapter_supports_push``,
the real ``APIServerAdapter`` whose ``supports_async_delivery = False`` is the
reason the narrowing is scoped to the push path at all, the real
``_clip_handoff`` / ``_kanban_handoff_with_result`` / ``_wake_kinds_for`` names
the notifier loop resolved, and — for the marker — a real ``SessionStore`` with
a real ``SessionEntry`` in it, the real ``GatewayRunner`` sidecar-note methods
and the real ``consume_gateway_turn_context_notes`` the next turn calls.
