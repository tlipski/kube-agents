"""Record cron occurrences that were due and did not run, and keep history per job.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/tools/cron_skip_ledger.py`` and wired
into ``cron/executions.py``, ``cron/scheduler.py``, ``cron/jobs.py`` and
``agent/monitoring/cron_health.py`` by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile``.

Two independent holes in the execution ledger, both of which make a watchdog
that stopped firing look exactly like a watchdog with nothing to report. That
is not hypothetical here: six governance watchdogs went a whole release without
firing and the ledger showed nothing wrong, because it had nothing to show.

Hole 1 — a skipped occurrence leaves no trace
---------------------------------------------
Upstream's ``executions`` table constrains ``status`` to
``('claimed','running','completed','failed','unknown')``. Every one of those
means *a run existed*. An occurrence that came due and was then dropped has no
representable state, so the scheduler does the only thing it can: it writes a
log line and returns. The log is rotated out of the pod in hours; the ledger is
on a PVC and is what anybody actually queries.

Measured on the live Chat Agent board on 2026-08-08 (``/opt/data/cron/
executions.db``): ``profile-cron-tick`` is a ``* * * * *`` job, and over a
999-minute window it holds 980 rows in 18 runs of consecutive minutes, every
gap ~120s. **Twenty occurrences of a minute-ly job left no record of any
kind** — and the gaps cluster on ``:00`` and ``:30``, the minutes when the
hourly and half-hourly jobs fire, so they are contention, not noise. Every one
of the board's 1000 rows reads ``completed``. There is no query against the
current schema that can find the twenty.

The five ways an occurrence is lost, all now recorded with a distinguishing
reason (the codes below are the vocabulary, and they are content-free so they
can also be projected to monitoring):

``already_running``
    ``tick``'s in-process dedup guard: ``job_id`` is still in
    ``_running_job_ids`` from a previous tick. The occurrence is genuinely
    lost, because ``advance_next_runs`` has *already* moved ``next_run_at``
    forward for the whole due set before dispatch begins. This is the common
    case above: a job whose run outlives its own period.

``already_running_elsewhere``
    The cross-process mirror of the same thing — ``_job_locks.claim`` refused,
    so another *process* holds the per-job flock (see
    ``tools/cron_tick_lock_scope.py``). Distinct from ``already_running``
    because the remedy is different: one says the job is too slow for its
    schedule, the other says two tickers are racing for the same profile.

``interpreter_shutdown``
    The gateway began finalizing between ``advance_next_runs`` and
    ``pool.submit``. ``next_run_at`` has moved, nothing was dispatched.
    Deliberately separated from a real dispatch failure: it is expected during
    a rollout and should not read as a fault.

``missed_window``
    The one that hides an outage. ``cron/jobs.py:get_due_jobs`` fast-forwards a
    job whose ``next_run_at`` is older than ``_compute_grace_seconds`` and
    fires it exactly once, deliberately collapsing every accumulated
    occurrence. Upstream's only trace is
    ``record_catch_up_occurrence()`` — a single integer in a file, profile-wide,
    with no job id, no timestamp and no count. A four-hour gateway outage
    therefore leaves a daily watchdog looking as though it ran on schedule. One
    row per gap, not one per lost occurrence: a three-hour outage of a
    minute-ly job would otherwise write 180 rows and evict the very history
    somebody is trying to read.

``dispatch_claim_rejected``
    A finite one-shot whose ``repeat.times`` was already consumed. Upstream
    already writes a row for this, but as ``failed`` — which is wrong twice
    over: it inflates the failure count that ``cron_health`` derives, and it
    describes a correctly-enforced at-most-once guarantee as a fault.

Two near-misses deliberately *not* recorded, because neither loses an
occurrence: the tick-lock contention path (``Tick skipped — another instance
holds the lock``) returns before ``get_due_jobs``, so the other tick fires
those jobs; and the ``can_dispatch()`` drain gate likewise leaves the due set
untouched for the next tick. Recording either would manufacture false skips.
The timezone-repair branch in ``get_due_jobs`` is also left alone: in the
common case it re-anchors onto the same wall-clock time later in the same
period and nothing is lost, so a row there would be a false positive in every
case but a rare DST collision.

Hole 2 — pruning is global, so a chatty job evicts a quiet one
---------------------------------------------------------------
``_prune_unlocked`` keeps the newest ``MAX_TERMINAL_EXECUTIONS`` terminal rows
**across all jobs**, so the horizon is the same 16.7 hours for every job on the
board and it is the busiest job that sets it. The live Chat Agent board was
saturated at 1000/1000: ``profile-cron-tick`` owned 980 of those rows,
``cluster-agent-reconcile`` (hourly) 16, ``github-issue-resolver`` 4. Replaying
one more day of both cadences against a copy of that board shows what the cap
does next — under the global rule the hourly job is left with 17 rows and
``github-issue-resolver`` with none at all; under the rule below the hourly job
keeps 40 and the half-hourly one keeps its 4. A daily watchdog on that board
retains at best a single row, and the first thing anybody asks about a watchdog
that went quiet is "when did it last succeed?".

Retention is therefore per job. The numbers, against the two real rosters
(``agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json``, ``agents/platform/cron/jobs.json``):

* ``MAX_TERMINAL_EXECUTIONS_PER_JOB = 1000``. Deliberately the same 1000
  upstream already chose — the cap was scoped wrong, not sized wrong. It is
  set by the fastest job on either roster, ``profile-cron-tick`` at
  ``* * * * *`` (1440 rows/day): 1000 rows is a 16.7-hour horizon, which is
  *exactly* the whole-board horizon observed today, so the busiest job loses
  nothing and every other job stops paying for it. The same 1000 rows buy
  ``cluster-agent-reconcile`` (``11 * * * *``) 41 days, ``github-issue-resolver``
  (``*/30 * * * *``) 20.8 days, the three daily audits ~2.7 years, and the
  three weekly ones roughly 19 — i.e. a daily watchdog is never pruned in
  practice, which is the point.

* ``MAX_TERMINAL_EXECUTIONS = 5000``, retained as an absolute ceiling and
  raised from 1000. A per-job rule alone is unbounded on the one axis that
  actually grows here: *distinct job ids*. The Platform Agent creates and
  removes jobs at runtime (per-cluster scaffolding, one-shot follow-ups), and
  a deleted job's rows are never reclaimed by a per-job cap. 5000 is five
  minute-ly jobs' worth, which is more job ids than either roster carries, so
  the ceiling only engages once dead job ids accumulate. At the ~0.6 KB/row the
  live board measures (610,304 bytes for 1000 rows, indexes included) the
  ceiling is ~3 MB per profile.

* ``MIN_TERMINAL_EXECUTIONS_PER_JOB = 50``. The ceiling sweep may never take a
  job's newest 50 terminal rows. Without a floor, raising the global cap only
  moves the crowd-out threshold — the ticker would still be the last writer
  standing. Fifty rows is 50 days for a daily watchdog and 50 weeks for a
  weekly one, i.e. the floor alone already answers "when did it last run?".
  The floor outranks the ceiling: with more than ``5000/50`` job ids on one
  board the protected rows exceed the ceiling and the ceiling gives way.
  That is the intended precedence — evidence beats a size target — and the
  real bound is ``MAX_TERMINAL_EXECUTIONS + 50 x (job ids)``. Both boards
  carry fewer than twenty.

Why the schema change is a table rebuild
-----------------------------------------
``status`` is guarded by a ``CHECK`` constraint, and SQLite cannot alter a
``CHECK`` in place. The only options are rebuild-and-rename or dropping the
constraint, and dropping it would trade a real invariant for convenience.

Both live ledgers are populated (1000 and 99 rows), on a PVC, in WAL mode,
opened concurrently by the gateway and by spawned ``hermes cron tick``
processes, and carry ``PRAGMA user_version = 0`` with no metadata table — so
there is no version counter to gate on. ``migrate_executions_table`` therefore
gates on the schema itself: it reads the live ``CREATE TABLE`` text out of
``sqlite_master`` and no-ops if that text already admits ``'skipped'``. That is
idempotent by construction and needs nothing persisted.

The rebuild derives the new table's DDL *from the live table's own DDL* — one
anchored regex substitution on the ``CHECK(status IN (...))`` list, one on the
table name — rather than from a hardcoded schema. Two reasons. It cannot drop a
column an upstream release added, because it never enumerates columns; and
``INSERT INTO ... SELECT *`` is then trivially correct, because the column
order is identical by construction. If either substitution does not match
exactly once the migration raises instead of guessing, and the build-time
verify turns that into a failed image rather than a ledger that silently
refuses every skip row.

Atomicity is explicit. ``_initialize_schema`` runs its DDL in autocommit, so
the rebuild opens its own ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``, re-reads the schema *inside* the
write lock (closing the read-then-upgrade race between two ticker processes),
compares row counts before and after the copy, and rolls the whole thing back
on any mismatch. A failed migration leaves the original table exactly as it
was; the caller keeps a working ledger for the four upstream statuses and only
loses the ability to record skips.

``skip_reason`` is added separately, by an idempotent ``ADD COLUMN``, because
``ADD COLUMN`` is the one schema change SQLite *can* do in place and pairing it
with the rebuild would make the rebuild's derived-DDL trick harder to reason
about. It runs first, so the rebuild carries it along. A machine-readable
column rather than a substring of ``error``: "which jobs are being skipped, and
for what" has to be a ``GROUP BY``, not a ``LIKE``.
