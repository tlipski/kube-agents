"""Build gate for the cron tick-lock-scope patch.

Run by deploy/docker/Dockerfile from /opt/hermes after
apply_cron_tick_lock_scope.py. The applier only proves eleven anchors matched;
it proves nothing about WHERE the release landed, and a release placed one
statement too early would silently break at-most-once.

Six checks, each a way the patch could match its anchors and still be wrong or
harmful:

1. RELEASE PLACEMENT. Parse the patched ``cron/scheduler.py::tick`` and assert
   the ``_tick_lock.release()`` statement sits inside the ``try``, strictly
   AFTER the ``advance_next_runs(...)`` call and after the last
   ``_submit_with_guard`` call, and strictly BEFORE the ``if sync:`` node.
   Releasing before the advance or before dispatch would reintroduce
   double-firing. The ``finally`` is also asserted to be the idempotent
   backstop and nothing else -- if it still touches ``lock_fd`` directly, the
   old wide-scope unlock survived alongside the new one.

2. THE CLAIM IS CARRIED, NOT LOOKED UP. Assert the dispatch guard binds
   ``_job_lock`` from ``_job_locks.claim(...)``, hands that object to
   ``_run_and_release`` as a default argument, releases through it, and that
   ``_job_locks.release(`` appears nowhere. Releasing by job id meant
   recomputing the lock path on a worker thread whose context can no longer
   resolve the profile -- see the "caller owns its claim" section of
   ``cron_tick_lock_scope.py``. The binding is also what keeps the lock object
   alive for the run's duration.

3. THE DISPATCH PATH CLAIMS BEFORE THE CAS. Assert
   ``tools/cronjob_tools.py::_execute_job_now`` claims the per-job flock on a
   line strictly before ``claim_job_for_fire`` -- after would leave
   ``next_run_at`` advanced for a run that was then refused -- and releases in
   a ``finally``, which is the only path out that a BaseException cannot skip.

4. THE SPAWNED TICK SWEEPS FIRST. Assert ``hermes_cli/cron.py::cron_tick``
   calls ``recover_interrupted_executions`` before ``tick``, and inside a
   ``try`` -- a bookkeeping sweep that raises must never cost the profile its
   tick.

5. HEAD-OF-LINE IS GONE, AND THE GUARD IS ARMED. Against a throwaway
   HERMES_HOME with one ``no_agent`` job whose script sleeps, run a real
   ``tick(sync=True)`` in a child process; once the ledger shows the job
   running, assert ``.tick.lock`` can be flock'd from this process (on the
   unpatched image it cannot -- that is the defect, stated as an assertion)
   and that ``.job-<id>.lock`` cannot. Then, with the child STILL ALIVE after
   its tick returns, assert the per-job lock is free: that proves the patched
   code released the claim rather than the kernel reaping it at exit, which is
   the half a dying process would hide.

6. A STUCK LEDGER ROW IS REAPED. Leave a ``running`` row behind from a child
   that exits without finishing it -- the live platform profile had six of
   these, the oldest a day old -- then run the patched ``cron_tick`` in another
   child and assert the row became ``unknown``.

Checks 5 and 6 are real cross-process exercises, not AST assertions: separate
interpreters hold the locks and own the ledger rows, and this process is the
second claimant. The kernel-releases-on-death property is pinned by the host
suite instead (``test_cron_tick_lock_scope.py``), because it needs a SIGKILL
that would make this file's child bookkeeping much harder to read.
