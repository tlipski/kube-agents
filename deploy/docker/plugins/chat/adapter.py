"""``deliver: "chat"`` — hand a cron job's report to the Chat Agent.

Installed at ``/opt/hermes/plugins/platforms/chat/`` so Hermes discovers it as a
bundled platform plugin. Nothing in the Hermes tree is edited: the scheduler
already routes ``deliver=<name>`` through the platform registry, and
``cron/scheduler.py::_plugin_cron_env_var`` says so in its own words —
plugins that set ``cron_deliver_env_var`` on their ``PlatformEntry`` "get cron
delivery support without editing this module".

Why a delivery mode and not a prompt instruction
------------------------------------------------

The relay itself — the Chat Agent composing the message, and the report being
stored against the thread it lands in — is ``docs/designs/cron-report-relay.md``.
This module is only about *what triggers* it.

The first cut triggered it from the job's prompt: call ``report_to_chat``, then
return ``[SILENT]``. That works for a roster shipped in the image, where the
prompt is reviewed alongside the job, and fails for everything else. A job the
user asks for at runtime ("watch that rollout every ten minutes and tell me when
it settles") is created through ``cronjob(action='create')`` with whatever prompt
the moment produced, so it carries no such contract — and its ``deliver`` then
resolves to a Google Chat home channel this image cannot hand a child profile,
i.e. to nowhere. The result is a job that runs forever and is never heard from,
which is the exact failure the relay exists to end.

``deliver`` is the field that already means "where does the output go", every
creation path can set it, and ``create_job``'s fixed keyword signature makes it
the only field a runtime-created job *can* set. So the relay is a platform, and
asking for it is one field.

Why this platform is not a platform
-----------------------------------

It has no inbound side and no adapter. ``adapter_factory`` exists because
``PlatformEntry`` requires one and raises if the gateway ever tries to build it —
which it will not, because ``_is_connected`` returns False unless
``CHAT_HOME_CHANNEL`` is set, and only ``profile_cron_tick.py`` sets it, for the
cron children it spawns. In the gateway process the platform stays unregistered
in the config, invisible to ``gateway status``, and starts nothing.

That one variable is the whole switch: it gates enablement (through
``is_connected``), it is the ``cron_deliver_env_var`` the scheduler reads to
resolve ``deliver: "chat"`` to a target, and where it is unset the platform
behaves as if this directory were not there.

What the sender can and cannot see
----------------------------------

``standalone_sender_fn`` is handed the delivery text, not the job. The job's id
and name are in the text, because ``_deliver_result`` wraps every cron delivery
in a two-line header before sending it, and :func:`parse_cron_wrapper` reads them
back out. That coupling is checked at image build time by
``deploy/docker/plugins/verify_chat_relay.py``, which drives the real
``_deliver_result`` and asserts on what arrived — so upstream changing the
wrapper fails the build rather than degrading in production.

If the header is ever absent (``cron.wrap_response: false`` turns it off), the
report still relays: it just arrives under a per-profile session for the day
instead of a per-job one, and says so in the log.
