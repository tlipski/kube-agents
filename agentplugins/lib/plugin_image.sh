# Image plumbing shared by the plugin installers. Source it; running it does nothing.
#
# Every plugin image in this directory is `FROM scratch` plus a COPY of one tree, so the
# entire build is a single tar layer. That is what makes a local build practical, and a
# local build is the point:
#
#   docker  builds the plugin's own Dockerfile and pushes it. Validates the Dockerfile.
#   crane   assembles the same layer and pushes it. No daemon, no Dockerfile.
#
# `gcloud builds submit` is deliberately not one of the options. Cloud Build rejects some
# corporate credentials for its own quota (`ACCESS_TOKEN_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED` on
# `serviceusage.services.use`), and it needs the API enabled and billing wired up before
# it will run at all — so an installer that can only build there fails on the machine
# where it is most often run. Both builders here run against the local filesystem and
# push straight to the registry.
#
# Everything that can fail before the first byte is pushed is settled by
# plugin_image_resolve, which the caller runs BEFORE it provisions anything: the project,
# the source tree, the builder, the Artifact Registry repository and the credential for
# it. A missing builder or an unauthenticated gcloud discovered at the end of the run
# leaves a half-provisioned project behind. Resolve proves the credential can be obtained
# but does not store one — see plugin_image_check_credential; the login that writes a
# token to disk happens around the push and nowhere else.
#
# What resolve cannot settle is authorization. Nothing short of a push tells you whether
# the credential may write to that repository, so a run that gets past resolve can still
# fail at the push — just not for any reason a person could have fixed up front.
# Publishing happens later:
#
#   . "${REPO_ROOT}/agentplugins/lib/plugin_image.sh"
#   plugin_image_resolve <plugin-name> <project> <plugin-dir> <source-dir> \
#       [<context> <namespace> <agent>]
#   … provision …
#   plugin_image_publish <plugin-dir> <source-dir>
#   helm upgrade --install … --set image="$PLUGIN_IMAGE_REF"
#
# <plugin-dir> is the chart directory, holding the Dockerfile and .dockerignore;
# <source-dir> is the tree the Dockerfile copies to /. Both functions take the pair, and
# for the same reason: what the image contains is <source-dir>, but how it is assembled
# is <plugin-dir>, and the tag has to cover both.

# layer, and once in each .dockerignore — with only a comment claiming the three agreed.
# Nothing enforced it, and the divergence would have been silent in the worst possible
# way: add a line to .dockerignore, and the build digest moves, so a NEW tag is minted,
# so the publish is not skipped — but only `docker build` honours the new line. crane
# would ship the excluded file anyway, under a tag that says it did not. Whichever
# builder reached that tag first would then define it forever, because publish skips a
# tag that already exists. One reader, used by both builders and by the tag, cannot do
# that.
#
# Matching follows Docker's rules for the subset of patterns these plugins use, and
# plugin_image_ignore_load REFUSES anything outside it. Refusing is the point: a pattern
# this cannot match the way Docker matches it is exactly the silent divergence above.
