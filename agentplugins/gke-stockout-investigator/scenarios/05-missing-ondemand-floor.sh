# The Spot-only class only demonstrates anything if its Spot tiers are genuinely
# unobtainable. The original pinning (c3-standard-88, then the c2 and e2 families) could
# not do that: `gcloud beta compute advice capacity` puts Spot obtainability for those at
# 0.5-0.9 in a healthy region, so the class was always satisfiable, the pods scheduled,
# and no scale-up failure was ever emitted.
#
# What is deterministic is that some families do not offer Spot *at all* in a region --
# the advisor rejects them with "Machine specification is not supported in locations"
# rather than scoring them. That is the ideal Rule D trigger, because the same shape is
# still available on demand: appending a non-Spot tier is a real fix, not a workaround.
# In us-east1 the H4D family is the only non-metal family with that property (metal
# shapes reject Spot too, but NAP cannot provision them for unrelated reasons, which
# would blame the wrong thing). Override with SCENARIO_MACHINES to force a list.

${SCENARIO_MACHINES// /, } is offered in ${CLUSTER_LOCATION} on demand but not on Spot in
any of its zones. That is what makes this a clean Rule D case rather than a shape-scarcity
one -- the capacity exists, and only the provisioning model puts it out of reach. An
investigation that blames regional scarcity has misread it."

This is also the scenario that should exercise the Spot capacity advisor. The skill mandates
`gcloud beta compute advice capacity` and `capacity-history`, and this is the case where
that output changes the recommendation rather than decorating it: the advisor says
which shapes and zones currently have Spot capacity, and whether the shortage looks
transient or sustained.

The expected proposal appends a non-Spot priority as the last tier so the workload
degrades to paying full price instead of not running, and keeps the Spot tiers ahead of
it so the cost saving survives. Removing Spot altogether would be an overcorrection
worth flagging.
