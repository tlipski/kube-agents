# --- fleet-audit cron prompts ---------------------------------------------
# Ground truth: the prompts in the cron manifest. Two site pages quote the

# was 348 lines with its checks at 56-270 when it was 406 lines with its checks
# at 102-314. A quotation that has drifted from the thing it quotes is worse
# than no quotation, so require it to be a literal substring of the manifest.
#
# The consequence to know before you write: `all N lines of it` is treated as a
# claim to be quoting a prompt, not as a phrase. Prose that paraphrases a
# watchdog rather than quoting it will fail this check even though nothing has
# drifted. Quote the prompt verbatim from the manifest, or describe it in words
# that avoid the idiom.
#
# Both rosters are ground truth. The governance prompts live on the Platform
# Agent's; the Chat Agent's is checked too so a job that moves between them
# does not turn every quotation stale on the way.
