# Prow CI Evaluation Pipeline Script
# ==============================================================================
# Runs devops-bench evaluation against deployed platform-agent.
#
# Evaluates the task matrix in section 6 EVAL_REPETITIONS times per task and
# hands the records to `bench-gate`, which applies the rate-based gate:
# a per-case verdict ladder, a collapse rule that needs every repetition to
# fail on a case with screening evidence, and a suite aggregate. The gate is
# two-speed as before -- deterministic verification keys block, judged scores
# are recorded and gate nothing -- but the decision now lives in tested Python
# (bench/kube_agents_bench/) rather than in inline heredocs here. This script
# keeps what is genuinely shell: the loop, the repetitions, the run-directory
# diffing and the artifact handling.
#
# Why a rate and not a pass: at two hundred cases and 95% per-case
# reliability, "every case passes every run" is clean on 0.003% of runs, and a
# gate that reds seven pull requests in eight is a gate people learn to
# ignore. See bench/baselines/README.md for what admits a case.

# ─── Eval dashboard publish hook (dashboard PR 4/4) ─────────────────────────
# Re-renders and republishes the eval dashboard at the very end of every
# MAIN-BRANCH run, red or green, from the EXIT trap below. FAIL-SAFE BY
# CONTRACT: the dashboard must never break the job it observes, so every
# failure mode -- the sibling dashboard PRs not merged yet (no
# scripts/eval_dashboard/), the IAM grant not applied, a gsutil error, a
# python crash, a hung upload -- logs exactly ONE
# "eval-dashboard publish skipped: <reason>" line and never changes the job's
# exit code.
#
# MAIN-BRANCH RUNS ONLY, the baseline store's trust boundary: a presubmit
# runs branch-authored code, so publishing from one would let any pull
# request rewrite the dashboard everyone reads -- both through the bucket
# credential and through collect.py, which reads TASKS and the domain
# metadata out of THIS checkout. The gate is the baseline recorder's
# (JOB_TYPE postsubmit/periodic, no PULL_NUMBER), re-derived here because the
# trap can fire from a set -e death long before that code runs. The gate
# alone is conventional -- a branch can edit this file -- which is why
# prerequisite 2 below puts the credential itself out of the presubmit's
# reach; that split is what makes the boundary structural, exactly as
# docs/designs/eval-scorer.md#the-two-service-accounts argues for the
# baseline store.
#
# Nothing publishes until BOTH prerequisites exist:
#   1. the nightly periodic (NEVER the presubmit) exports
#      EVAL_DASHBOARD_TARGET (gs://kube-agents-dashboards/evals/, a dedicated
#      bucket in the team's own project) -- an oss-test-infra change;
#   2. a DEDICATED publisher identity bound to that periodic alone --
#      eval-dashboard-publisher@kube-agents-prow.iam.gserviceaccount.com via
#      Workload Identity, the eval-baseline-recorder pattern from
#      docs/designs/eval-scorer.md#provisioning-it, NEVER the shared
#      prowjob-default-sa every presubmit also runs as -- holding
#      roles/storage.objectUser on the kube-agents-dashboards bucket (a grant
#      in the team's project, not the OSS Prow infra project). Republishing
#      overwrites the same object paths, so any workable role carries
#      storage.objects.delete; the boundary is the identity, not the role:
#      no account a presubmit can run as ever holds a write on this bucket.
#      The same identity also needs READ on the sweep's source --
#      roles/storage.objectViewer on gs://kube-agents-prow -- unless that
#      bucket's existing public read already covers it; without it the first
#      armed run 403s, which the zero-runs floor below turns into a skip,
#      never into publishing an empty dashboard over a good one.
# Until both land this costs one log line per run.

# 2b. Seeded-fleet credentials, one kubeconfig per fixture ROLE.
#
# The get-credentials above is the ONLY one this script used to do, and it
# points at platform-agent-host. The seeded fleet (bench/tf/fleet/) is other
# clusters, so a cluster-state check reading the ambient kubeconfig asks the
# wrong API server -- blocker A5 in bench/tasks/DRAFTS.md. This writes the
# fleet's credentials into their own files, keyed by fixture role, and touches
# neither the ambient kubeconfig nor the current context.
#
# Clusters are found by label rather than by name, so this does not need to
# know the leased project's cluster prefix or region.
#
# Non-fatal by design: an unreachable seeded cluster -- or a leased project the
# fleet was never applied to -- leaves its roles' files absent, and
# `fleet_resource_property` turns that into status=error naming the role and
# the project: failing the checks that needed that cluster rather than the job,
# and never silently reading platform-agent-host instead.
#
# It ran on every presubmit for weeks while every task that consumes it was
# still commented out of TASKS below, and that was the point: the warnings it
# prints per project ("carries no clusters labelled environment=seeded") are
# how a pool project still needing bench/tf/fleet applied was found BEFORE
# these tasks started gating PRs rather than after. Eleven of the active
# tasks below read the seeded fleet (six domain probes, the fleet-audits
# canary, cluster-agent-crashloop-debug and the three cluster-debugging
# cases beside it), so those warnings have consumers. It costs one
# clusters.list, one get-credentials per seeded cluster, and one namespace
# read per probe -- seconds, against a job measured in tens of minutes.
#
# The `||` catches a REPOSITORY bug only: a missing or malformed
# bench/tf/fleet/fixtures.json, or an unusable output directory. Every
# environmental failure -- no fleet in this project, a cluster that will not
# answer, a fixture that was never planted -- returns 0 with a warning of its
# own and leaves the affected roles' files absent, which is the whole design.

# The read-only identity the role kubeconfigs should carry. It cannot be a
# static export in the Prow job the way EVAL_GITHUB_APP_ID is: the account is
# per project (`seeded-fleet-reader@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`,
# bench/tf/fleet/main.tf:123) and Boskos picks the project at lease time, so
# this is the first point in the run that knows which one to name. An
# explicitly-set value still wins, for a laptop pointing at a fleet it does not
# own.
#
# Only half of this is in the repository. The other half is the token-creator
# grant -- `fleet_reader_token_creators` in bench/tf/fleet/variables.tf, empty
# by default -- which is a per-project `tofu apply` a human has to do, naming
# that project's Prow runner identity. Until it is done in a leased project,
# `gcloud auth print-access-token --impersonate-service-account` fails,
# fleet-kubeconfigs.sh warns per cluster, and the role kubeconfigs keep the
# runner's own read-write credential. That is a privilege gap on a fleet every
# open PR shares, not a functional one: the files are still written, still
# point at the right seeded cluster, and every check still grades the right
# object. See bench/tf/fleet/README.md, "A read-only credential for

  # defect, graded on the reply, the shape cluster-agent-crashloop-debug
  # proved at 142s -- and exactly ONE full audit stays active as the
  # machinery canary: compliance-rbac-overgrant, the measured-clean one,
  # which exercises SOP dispatch, delegation, the token minter and the
  # ledger write end to end under the fleet-audits domain. Budget: canary

  # A1 and A4 are CLOSED, and the canary above is what has EXERCISED them.
  # Both were one Prow-side change away with their repository halves already
  # on main. GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra#2661 merged
  # 2026-08-25T14:36:08Z and supplied both: it exports
  # EVAL_GITHUB_APP_ID=4675512, which is the condition hack/ci-deploy.sh
  # requires (with the GitOps repo gitops_repo_for_project() resolves from the
  # leased PROJECT_ID) before it renders githubMinter.enabled=true and passes
  # platformAgent.integration.github.gitRepo -- so `Git Repo:` in the rendered
  # SETTINGS.md now names the leased project's throwaway
  # gke-agentic/kube-agents-evals*-infra repo instead of the literal None, and
  # audit_report.py start has a workspace to clone and a minter to clone it
  # with (A1). And it mounts secret kube-agents-bench-github-token as
  # BENCH_GITHUB_TOKEN into this job, which is the credential
  # ledger_issue_contains reads the published ledger issue with (A4).
  # The 2026-08-26 run minted, cloned and published through that path twice
  # (compliance's ledger, and the upgrade audit's worker filing issue #3 in
  # gke-agentic/kube-agents-evals-3-infra while the harness was deaf to it),
  # so A1/A4 are exercised as well as closed.
  #
  # A5 is CLEARED, and that is what every fleet entry above rests on. Step 2b
  # writes one kubeconfig per seeded-fleet fixture ROLE, and the fleet
  # safeguards use `fleet_resource_property` with a `fixture_role:` instead of
  # reading the ambient kubeconfig (which is platform-agent-host and carries
  # no seeded namespace). The fleet is applied in EVERY project the Boskos
  # pool can lease, each planted defect verified present: step 2b reports
  # "7 role(s) written ... 0 whose fixtures were not present" against all
  # three, re-measured 2026-08-25. One residual, which is hardening rather
  # than a gate: with FLEET_READONLY_SA unset, or with the token-creator grant
  # not applied in the leased project, the role kubeconfigs carry the runner's
  # own identity, which can write to the shared fleet (roles/container.admin
  # via the GKE IAM webhook, nothing to narrow in-cluster). The checks read
  # correctly either way; the safeguards above are in fact what would DETECT
  # such a write. bench/tf/fleet/README.md, "A read-only credential for
  # evaluations", has the closing steps.
  #
  # Still blocked, one reason each:
  #   A3  fleet-cost-idle-pool is date-gated by the SOP's own do-not-flag
  #       rules, not by anything this repository can fix. Its objective
  #       requires BOTH idle-batch-pool and an orphan-pd- disk in finding_ids,
  #       and check 3.4's disk filter is the literal creationTimestamp<-P30D.
  #       Boskos leases at random, so the gate is the NEWEST fleet in the
  #       pool: kube-agents-evals-3 was planted 2026-08-24, three days after
  #       the other two, which makes it 2026-08-31 for the pool and
  #       2026-09-23 for the disks. A replant in any pool project moves them,
  #       and so does REGISTERING one: kube-agents-evals-4/-5/-6 are
  #       provisioned (scripts/provision_ci_pool_project.sh, 2026-08-25/26)
  #       but have no Boskos entry yet -- adding one moves the gate to
  #       2026-09-02 and 2026-09-25.
  #       It no longer costs domain coverage: cost-idle-pool-probe above asks
  #       the INSTANTANEOUS question (no age gate), so the cost domain is
  #       covered while this SOP-faithful audit waits for its calendar.
  #   A2  chat-routing-fleet-question. AGENT_SERVICE_NAME above is one global
  #       target, so every entry here reaches the platform agent; this
  #       scenario needs the chat front door and would fail its delegation
  #       objective on a correct system until the harness can target an agent
  #       per task. It costs no domain coverage: the two kanban probes already
  #       cover chat-and-routing.

  # Refusal variant of cluster debugging, and not one of the nine above. Its
  # compliant answer is a pull request on the eval GitOps repo, so it was A1's
  # until A1 closed; A5's residual is the same privilege gap every fleet case
  # carries. It is graded as a platform-agent case rather than a cluster-agent
  # one because AGENT_SERVICE_NAME above is a single global target -- that is
  # A2, and it shapes what the case asserts rather than blocking it. What it
  # waits on now is having been watched to both pass and fail
  # (`validated: false` in the file). Uncommenting a case nobody has run is
  # how a case that can only fail reds every pull request here.

# job alone only by failing ALL of them. Two-of-three would fire 1.45 times per
# pull request by chance at suite scale; three-of-three fires 0.03 times.
# Each repetition is one unit of the parallel fan-out below, so at
# parallelism P this multiplies wall-clock by roughly 3/P, not 3; scale past
# that is issue #902's lane. The serial measurements kept below predate the
# fan-out and are its baseline.
#
# TWENTY tasks at three repetitions is SIXTY devops-bench invocations,
# where the presubmit's budget was sized for two. The per-invocation cost is no
# longer an extrapolation from other builds: THIS matrix has run end to end, at
# thirteen tasks x three repetitions, on build 2093054834931404800
# (2026-08-27, GREEN).
#
#   whole job, wall clock                                       156.8min
#     of which the 39 invocations                               140.4min
#     of which fixed (Boskos, image build 756s, deploy 913s,
#       teardown)                                                16.4min
#
# So an invocation averages 3.6min, not the 4.7min extrapolated from #956's and
# #982's builds -- those over-read it. Twenty tasks x three is 60 invocations
# and ~216min, ~232min once the fixed term is added back, or 1.55x against the
# 360m deadline.
#
# One term in that is still a substitution rather than a measurement:
# rca-remediation-pr, activated by #998 so that its own smoke run would BE the
# first measurement, is priced at the fleet average. It is one of the two active
# tasks that WRITE, so compliance-rbac-overgrant is the better comparable at a
# measured 681s per repetition -- at that cost the total is ~239min of
# invocations, ~256min with the fixed term, and 1.41x. 1.41x is the arithmetic's
# honest figure and 1.55x its optimistic one -- but for this matrix the
# arithmetic is no longer the best estimate; #1049's measured draft runs,
# recorded below, supersede it.
#
# THE SEVENTEEN-TASK RUN HAS LANDED, and the honest figure was right: build
# 2094466401401049088 (2026-08-31, GREEN) came in at 221.7min whole-job against
# the 223.2min predicted, 1.5min apart, with the optimistic 200min nowhere near.
# It was the last SERIAL run before the fan-out below, so it prices the baseline
# rather than what the job costs now. What it settles is that the 3.6min average
# and the 16.4min fixed term extrapolate honestly, which is what the four
# estimates before them did not.
#
# Keep this count current when you activate: it was written at FOURTEEN, was
# already one short the day #925 wrote it (the matrix stood at fifteen), and
# #1045 took it to sixteen without touching it. Recount the uncommented entries
# in TASKS rather than incrementing what is here.
#
# The budget has been raised three times to get here, all merged: oss-test-infra
# #2667 took it 85m -> 150m off an estimate, #2669 took it 150m -> 240m off a
# ten-task measurement, and #2676 took it 240m -> 360m on 2026-08-31. 150m would
# still have been a guaranteed timeout, which is what made #2669 a prerequisite
# rather than a follow-up.
#
# #2676 is also why #1049's three activations need no companion raise, and this
# time the figure is measured rather than projected: their activating pull
# request ran the matrix three times as a draft -- twice at eighteen tasks
# (builds 2093444111125188608 and 2093496299662872576, 197.9min and ~180min
# against the then-240m deadline), then the nineteen-task serial run (build
# 2094442155576659968, 2026-08-31, GREEN) at ~308min against 360m. ~308min plus
# security-overgrant-remediation-proposal's measured ~9min (178s x 3) projects
# the full twenty-task job at ~317min serial: 1.14x. The 3.6min-average
# arithmetic above under-prices this matrix -- autoops-warning-event-triage's
# debounce-and-card wait lives in the measurement, not the average -- so 1.14x,
# not 1.41x, is the honest figure.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE ACTIVATING ANOTHER CASE. The budget lives in another
# repository, so every activation here silently spends headroom that only a
# separate pull request can replace, and this number was invalidated FIVE times
# by a matrix that grew after it was computed (#956, then #982, then #998, then
# #1049's three) before and after real runs replaced the arithmetic. At the
# measured ~317min serial, ~43min of serial headroom remains. Each further
# average-cost case adds ~11min of INVOCATION time and a canary-cost case
# ~34min -- divided by however much of EVAL_TASK_PARALLELISM the fan-out below
# actually realises against the pool's model quota, which the first parallel
# Prow run will measure. Until it has, budget serially, and recount before you
# trust the headroom: on the serial figures even the canary case squeaks under
# only at 0.97x, which is the kind of margin this number's five invalidations
# were made of. The NEXT activation is therefore a raise-first change unless
# the in-flight runtime-reduction work lands first. Activating a case and
# raising the budget are one change in two repositories, not a change and a
# follow-up.
#
# The variance that was flagged as the thing to watch has resolved in the good
# direction: consistency-authorized-networks-probe took 1039s on the one earlier
# run that existed, against the 150-350s #956 budgeted per probe. On this matrix
# it took 699s for all THREE repetitions -- 233s each. 1039s was one bad sample,
# not its normal cost.
#
# The expensive term is instead compliance-rbac-overgrant at 2042s for three
# repetitions (681s each), which is 24% of the whole task budget on its own.
#
# Setting this to 1 is how the refactor gets a run directly comparable to the
# old one-run-per-task gate, and it is a legitimate thing to do by hand on a
# pull request. It is not a legitimate default: at 1 the collapse rung
# degenerates to "the single run failed", which is exactly the trigger-happy

# that is not a real run) stay blocking for every case by design,
# admitted or not -- see grade_case, which evaluates them before it reads
# admission. security-overgrant-remediation-proposal (#1066) is simply
# new: it earns its record like any case, then enters. The other three

#
#   capacity-pinned-pool-probe            -- #1010: worker completes its
#     card at fan-out ("Awaiting synthesis" as the final answer). The
#     failure is correlated across repetitions when the agent chooses to
#     fan out, so the collapse rule does not absorb it. Enters when the
#     fix merges.
#   cluster-agent-healthy-workload-no-finding -- #1100: the agent invents
#     a finding on a healthy workload ~1 run in 8. Main's own trait, so a
#     collapse would tax an innocent PR. Enters when the false-positive
#     rate drops or when rung-6 screening can compare against main.
#   autoops-warning-event-triage          -- #1101: 0/5 graded repetitions
#     on record; admitting it reds every pull request today. Enters when
#     the lettered-options bar is settled and it has a clean record.
#
# If an admitted case reds a pull request its diff cannot explain on a
# graded failure, demote it here and reference its issue. Demotion is a
# one-line same-day edit to this list -- this file, not the Prow config,
# is deliberately the fast lever. It is the lever for rung-4 reds ONLY: a
# rung-1-3 red (mutation, erroring verifier, empty record) does not stop
# when its case leaves this list, because those classes signal a broken
# case or install, not flake, and the fix is on that side.

# suite`'s now, computed from the per-case JSON rather than from shell state
# accumulated in the loop.

# Baseline collection, and it runs BEFORE the verdict on purpose: the suite
# step exits 1 on a red, which under `set -e` would skip everything after it.
# A red run on main is precisely the evidence that de-admits a case that has
# stopped working, so it is the one run that must not go unrecorded.
#
# Only a run on main appends: the nightly periodic today, and a postsubmit if
# one is ever added back. `bench-gate record` refuses a second time if
# PULL_NUMBER is set, because a guard that lives only in shell is one careless
# edit away from letting a pull request move the baseline it is judged against.
#
# JOB_TYPE is matched against both because the recorder moved from per-merge to
# nightly. At ~10 merges a day a postsubmit paid ~40 minutes of cluster
# provisioning for three samples of each case, and provisioning -- not the eval
# -- is what the job spends its time on. One nightly run amortises that setup
# over every repetition, so it buys a sample far cheaper and can refill the
# whole 20-run admission window in a night or two after a version-key bump
# instead of over a week of merges. Neither job type is a pull request, which
# is the property that actually matters here; PULL_NUMBER below is what
# enforces it. See docs/designs/eval-scorer.md#the-job-that-writes-it.
#
# With EVAL_BASELINE_STORE pointing at a bucket the append lands and the loop
# closes. Unset, the store is the git checkout and this job has no push
# credential, so the append dies with the workspace; --lines-out is what
# survives, as a Prow artefact somebody lands by hand in the meantime.
