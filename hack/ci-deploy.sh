# ─── 2b. GitOps Repository for This Run ───────────────────────────────────────
# Every GitHub-writing eval scenario begins by reading the `Git Repo:` line out
# of /opt/data/SETTINGS.md — the fleet-audit streams do it in `audit_report.py
# start`, before anything else happens. The operator renders that line from
# spec.integration.github.gitRepo on the PlatformAgent CR
# (buildSettingsConfigMap in k8s-operator/internal/controller/
# platformagent_manifests.go); with the field unset it writes the literal
# "None" and those scenarios stop at step 0 with nothing to clone.
#
# CI supplies the value and deliberately does NOT lean on the chart default.
# Everything this job deploys — chart, operator, agent — is built from the pull
# request, so a PR that blanks `platformAgent.integration.github.gitRepo` in
# values.yaml, or breaks the CR-to-SETTINGS.md rendering, is precisely the
# regression the eval should catch as a failed scenario. It can only catch it
# if the value the run is supposed to use arrives from outside the artefacts
# under test. Note this is a *correctness* argument, not the containment
# boundary: what a run can actually write to is fixed by which repositories the
# GitHub App is installed on, which no PR can change. See
# docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/ci-pool-projects.md.
#
# One GitOps repo per leasable project, so two concurrent leases can never
# share a ledger issue or race on a remediation branch. Onboarding a further
# project (issue #637, Boskos leasing) is one line here plus its row in that
# same doc — no other edit in this file.
#
# A mapping here is a claim that the repo exists and that App 4675512 is
# installed on it. It is not self-verifying: with the line present and either
# of those missing, the deploy succeeds and every GitHub-writing scenario
# fails at `audit_report.py start` with a clone or token error instead of the
# named, actionable refusal below. Add the row when the repo and the
# installation are real, not when the project joins the Boskos pool — the two
# are separate events, and kube-agents-evals-3 is what happens when they are
# assumed to be one.

# stack, so the connection is refused (scripts/exec_tunnel.py is canonical on
# this). On a pool cluster with no `gvisor` RuntimeClass the pod would not
# schedule at all. Either way this job wants the standard runtime; what the
# sandbox does to the agent is the release pipeline's to exercise, not a smoke
