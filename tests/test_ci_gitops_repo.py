"""Tests for the GitOps-repository resolution in hack/ci-deploy.sh.

The presubmit eval's GitHub-writing scenarios read the `Git Repo:` line out of
/opt/data/SETTINGS.md, which the operator renders from the PlatformAgent CR's
spec.integration.github.gitRepo. CI has to supply that value, and the whole
point of how it supplies it is the *failure* behaviour:

* one GitOps repository per leasable project, never a shared default -- two
  Boskos leases must not write to the same ledger issue;
* an unmapped project stops the deploy, in Prow and on a laptop alike, rather
  than silently installing an agent with an empty gitRepo (every scenario then
  fails at step 0 for a reason no log explains) or, worse, one pointed at some
  other project's repository;
* under Prow the in-repo table is the only source, because the project is
  leased per run and a value pinned in the job environment would eventually
  outlive the lease it was written for.

None of that is observable from a successful run, which is exactly why it
regresses quietly. The block is extracted from the script by its section
markers and executed, so these assertions are against the code that ships
rather than a copy.
