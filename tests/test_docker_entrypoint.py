"""Tests for the shared-state gate in deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh.

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'

The Deployment runs this image twice against ONE data PVC — the gateway
(`hermes gateway run`) and the dashboard (`hermes dashboard`) — but the operator mounts
the plugin image volumes and the operator-rendered config overlays into the gateway
container only. Everything the entrypoint does below step 1.5 writes to that shared tree,
so the two containers must not both run it: the dashboard's pass reads the gateway's fresh
plugin links as dangling and unlinks them, and reverts the overlay it finds no source for.

That failure is silent where it happens and loud somewhere else — a kanban worker exits 1
with "Unknown skill(s)", retries twice, and the board fills with blocked tasks while the
AgentPlugin still reports Ready. Nothing downstream of the gate can catch it, so the gate
is tested here directly.

The setup steps are all guarded on paths that exist only inside the image (/opt/defaults,
/opt/hermes), so running the real script on a host is safe: the one observable thing it
does is create $PLATFORM_AGENT_HOME/logs at step 5. That directory is the probe for
"did the setup run".

That probe is valid ON A HOST ONLY, and the reason is the same absent /opt/hermes. Inside
the image, step 1 runs upstream's stage2-hook.sh above the gate and lays down the Hermes
skeleton — logs/ included — in EVERY container, so there logs/ proves nothing. Anything
re-checking this against a real container wants scripts/ or profiles/platform/profile.yaml
instead, which only the gated steps below create.

        of restoring. Unguarded, the rollback buries the profile's previous skills
