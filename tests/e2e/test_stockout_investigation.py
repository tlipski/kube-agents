    """Waits for the deployed stockout plugin to settle, then refuses to run on a broken one.

    Installs the plugin only when the AgentPlugin CR is absent, which is what this fixture
    has always done. What it adds is the waiting: step 2 of the RC pipeline provisions the
    environment immediately before this module runs, so the gateway may still be rolling
    when the first scenario starts, and the plugin's skill is linked by the entrypoint of
    whichever pod wins. Probing before that settles reads the outgoing pod.

    That is not a hypothetical. Run 32866087154 reported `SKILL.md not found under the
    platform profile's plugins directory` and every selected scenario then burned its full
    360s watch to report "Platform Agent never started investigation"; run 32953137904, on
    the same cluster, found the skill present. The difference between them is which pod the
    preflight caught, and this fixture is what removes that from the result.

    Three waits, in this order: the AgentPlugin's status catches up to its spec, the gateway
    finishes rolling, and the plugin's SKILL.md is readable inside the pod that survived.
    Any of them failing ends the module naming what was wrong, in place of ten minutes of
    watch timeouts that name nothing.

    Deliberately not a reinstall. Running `install.sh` every session would repair an
    AgentPlugin whose rendered spec has drifted from this candidate's, but it repairs
    nothing in the common case — an unchanged plugin source tree renders a byte-identical
    CR — while adding unconditional writes to the RC's critical path, including four
    `add-iam-policy-binding` calls that read-modify-write the *project* IAM policy. An IAM
    race unrelated to the candidate would then block the release. Drift is worth detecting;
    the checks below do that and say so, rather than papering over it with a write.
