"""Dispatcher for the ``bootstrap-inventory-scan`` cron job.

First-time onboarding needs a full GKE discovery sweep (control plane options,
node pools, Workload Identity, running workloads): the sweep writes the
complete findings to ``INVENTORY.raw.md``, and a second card ranks them into
the short report the user receives. That is LLM work AND privileged work, and the
profile this cron runs on can do neither: the Chat Agent's toolsets are
deliberately stripped to ``mcp-router`` + ``kanban`` (no terminal, no gcloud,
no kubectl), so it cannot run the sweep itself even as an LLM job.

Nor can the job simply move to ``platform``. Every marker that makes onboarding
once-only — ``.bootstrap_scan_filed`` below, ``.bootstrap_completed``,
``INVENTORY.raw.md``, and the ``INVENTORY.md`` the delivery job reads — lives
in the Chat Agent's home, and a
job on the platform profile would gate itself on a different directory. (Cron
on a named profile does now fire, via ``profile_cron_tick.py``; that is no
longer the reason this lives here.)

So this runs as a ``no_agent`` script — a plain subprocess, not bound by the
Chat Agent's toolset denylist — and files the sweep as a **kanban task assigned
to** ``platform``, the privileged specialist. The dispatcher spawns that worker
with its full toolset; the worker writes the raw findings, files the
prioritization card, and completes its own card.

Filing is once-only, and this job owns that guarantee locally: the id of the
card it filed is recorded in ``.bootstrap_scan_filed``, and while that marker
exists no further card is ever filed. The board's ``idempotency_key`` is kept
as a second line of defence for the one window the marker cannot cover (the
card was created but the run died before the marker was written) — but it is
not the guarantee. It cannot be: it dedupes against non-archived rows in one
board's database, so an archived card, a recreated board, or a reset volume
would hand a 1-minute cron job licence to launch a fresh fleet-wide sweep
every single minute. That is the "bootstrap ran several times" failure.

The marker is also what makes a delegated sweep safe, and that is what broke
here. Since the sweep started fanning out to subagents, the card this job
files is completed almost immediately — the worker's job is to delegate, not
to scan, so it hands the real work to per-cluster child cards and finishes.
The findings appear minutes later, from the aggregation card, and
``INVENTORY.md`` minutes after that, from the prioritization card the sweep
files. For that whole window the board says "done" and the disk says "no
report", which is indistinguishable from "never scanned" — so a 1-minute job
with no memory of its own re-files the sweep, once a minute, for as long as
the real work takes. Only a marker written at file time closes that window,
and adding a prioritization stage lengthened the window it has to cover.

Deleting ``.bootstrap_scan_filed`` — together with ``INVENTORY.raw.md``, which
nothing else ever removes and which ``should_skip`` also gates on — is the
supported way to re-arm discovery after a sweep has genuinely failed. Deleting
the marker alone leaves the gate closed.

Output is intentionally empty: ``deliver: local`` plus empty stdout means the
scheduler treats every run as silent. The report reaches the user through
``bootstrap_delivery.py``, not through this job.

    ``hermes profile list`` exits 127 there while working fine from an
    interactive shell, which is why this was not obvious.

    HERMES_HOME pinned unconditionally, because the absolute path ALONE is
    worse than the 127. The worker is not missing a HERMES_HOME — it has one,
    pinned to its own profile home, and profiles resolve at
    ``$HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>``. Under the worker's value hermes exits 0
    and prints a plausible roster that is missing profiles (observed:
    ``default`` only, with ``platform`` absent — the view from inside a
    profile home). A defaulted expansion like ``${HERMES_HOME:-...}``
    preserves exactly that wrong value; only an unconditional pin gives the
    fleet-wide view. A loud failure gets retried; a quiet wrong answer gets
    believed, and on a real fleet it silently drops clusters from the sweep.

    The pinned value is this gate's own data root, resolved when the card is
