"""Unit tests for the no-LLM onboarding cron scripts.

Run: python3 -m unittest agents/chat/scripts/test_bootstrap_onboarding_scripts.py

Covers the deterministic decision + I/O logic of:
  - bootstrap_delivery.py  (no_agent delivery of INVENTORY.md, exactly once)
  - bootstrap_scan_gate.py (files the sweep as a kanban task; stops re-filing)

The in-process job removal in bootstrap_delivery._cleanup imports cron.jobs,
which is unavailable here; its import is guarded, so _cleanup degrades to a
no-op for job removal while still archiving INVENTORY.md.

The theme of these tests is that onboarding happens ONCE. Each stage is
therefore checked twice: once for doing its job, and once for refusing to do it
again.
