# agent_roster.py - Which specialist profiles exist, and what each is for.
#
# The Chat Agent needs this to pick an `assignee` before it delegates, and it
# needs it on essentially every request. Two consumers read it:
#
#   * ``router_server.py``'s ``list_agents`` MCP tool — the on-demand refresh
#     path, for when a named agent is missing or the injected roster is stale.
#   * the ``agent_roster`` plugin (``agents/chat/defaults/plugins/agent_roster``)
#     — injects the roster into every turn's context, so the common case costs
#     no tool call at all. Measured on the live deployment, calling the tool cost
#     a full LLM roundtrip (~6s of a ~17s acknowledgement) to re-read what is, in
#     the end, a directory listing.
#
# Both must describe the same fleet in the same words, which is the reason this
# lives in its own module rather than being duplicated into the plugin: a roster
# that disagrees with itself between the injected block and the tool is worse
# than either one alone.
#
# Everything here degrades rather than raises. The profiles live on a shared
# PVC, so an I/O or permission fault must not turn routing into a traceback.
