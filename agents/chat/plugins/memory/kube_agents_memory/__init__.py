"""Per-user and shared memory for the Chat Agent, in one Hindsight bank.

Everyone's memory lives in a single bank. What separates one person's memories
from another's is a **scope tag** carried by every fact: ``user:<id>`` for a
private memory, ``scope:shared`` for one the whole organisation can read. Recall
asks for the current user's tag plus the shared tag; nothing else can come back.

Hindsight has all the machinery for this — tags on retain, tag filters on recall,
tag-scoped consolidation. What it does not have is any way to get the *current
user's id* into that configuration. ``{user}`` substitution exists but is wired
to exactly one setting: ``_resolve_bank_id_template`` is called for ``bank_id``
and nothing else (upstream ``plugins/memory/hindsight/__init__.py``), while
``retain_tags`` and ``recall_tags`` are read as literal strings. Configure
``retain_tags: "user:{user_id}"`` and every user is tagged with the characters
``user:{user_id}``. That is the gap this wrapper closes, and it is most of what
it does: resolve the identity, then hand the stock provider the right tags.

Three upstream behaviours make the difference between isolation and a leak, and
each is pinned in ``client.apply_scoping`` rather than left to configuration:

* **``any_strict``, never ``any``.** Hindsight's tag matcher treats ``any``/``all``
  as *"matching tags **or** no tags at all"* — only the ``_strict`` variants
  exclude untagged rows (``engine/search/tags.py``). The plugin's default is
  ``any``. In a single bank that default hands every untagged memory to every
  user, so ``_recall_tags_match`` is forced to ``any_strict``.

* **Reflect ignores tags.** ``hindsight_reflect`` and reflect-mode prefetch both
  call ``areflect(bank_id, query, budget)`` with no tag arguments, so a reflect
  would reason across every user in the bank. The REST API and the client both
  accept ``tags``/``tags_match`` — it is only the plugin that omits them — so
  ``memory_reflect`` is implemented against the client directly, and prefetch is
  pinned to ``recall`` mode.

* **Observation scopes are pinned explicitly.** Recall returns *observations*,
  not raw facts, so isolation is only real if the observation layer is scoped
  too. Hindsight's default (``combined``) scopes an observation by the full tag
  set of its sources — and the stock provider attaches a ``session:<id>`` tag to
  every auto-retained turn. That would make each session its own scope, so
  nothing a user said last week would ever consolidate with what they say today.
  Setting ``observation_scopes`` to an explicit ``[[scope_tag]]`` fixes both
  halves at once: one durable scope per user, immune to whatever per-call
  provenance tags ride along. Hindsight's own consolidator documents this as the
  intended use of explicit scopes.

A fourth upstream behaviour is corrected rather than pinned. The stock read
tools answer an empty result with the string ``"No relevant memories found."``,
which a model reads as *no such record exists* — a claim it will then make
confidently about a store that holds the fact. ``memory_recall`` and
``memory_reflect`` therefore name their outcome (``found`` / ``no_match`` /
``unreachable``) and report the search they ran, so absence is attributable to a
query and a scope. See ``prompts.NO_MATCH_GUIDANCE``.

The two banks this replaced also carried a mission each — what the bank is for,
and what is worth extracting into it. One bank has one ``retain_mission``, but
``retain_mission`` is a per-bank *configurable* field, and configurable fields
can be overridden per item by a named **retain strategy**. So the personal and
shared extraction guidance survives as strategies (``personal``/``shared``)
rather than as separate banks, with ``retain_default_strategy`` making the
personal one apply to automatic capture.

Everything else is still the stock provider, loaded through
``load_memory_provider("hindsight")``. Not forking its ~92 KB implementation is
deliberate: a Hermes base-image bump brings Hindsight fixes along with it and
there is no merge to redo.

**Layout.** This module is the entry point and nothing else. The implementation
is four modules, split along the lines of what would break if each changed:

* ``config_schema`` — the bank name, the two scope tags, the retain strategies
  and missions provisioned onto the bank, and the profile-config reads. Changing
  anything here is a data-migration question, and three consumers outside the
  package restate these values.
* ``prompts`` — everything the model reads: system prompt variants, the tool
  schemas, and the guidance that keeps ``no_match`` from being reported as
  nonexistence. Changing anything here is an agent-behaviour question.
* ``client`` — the only module that reaches into the stock Hindsight provider or
  its generated client. A Hermes base-image bump lands here.
* ``session`` — the provider class: identity resolution, the three session
  states, and tool dispatch.
