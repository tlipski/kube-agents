"""pr_conversation.py — deterministic helper for the pr-conversation skill.

Three subcommands, one job each:

* ``poll`` — print the unanswered requests on one pull request, or all of them,
  as JSON, each alongside the conversation it arrived in. The
  `github-repo-watcher` cron job runs the same logic to decide whether to file a
  card; this exposes it so the worker can re-read the truth in Step 1, and so a
  human debugging a missed trigger can run the exact thing the watcher ran.
* ``reply`` — post a comment from a file and stamp it with the marker that
  records the request as answered.
* ``refuse`` — the same, with the refusal marker, for a request the agent has
  decided it will not act on.

Why ``reply`` writes the marker rather than the model
-----------------------------------------------------
The marker is the whole idempotency scheme: a request is unanswered when no
self-authored comment carries ``<!-- agent-answered:<node-id> -->``. If the model
had to remember to type it, the failure mode of forgetting is not a missing
comment — it is the same request being answered again on every tick, ten minutes
apart, forever. So the marker is appended here, from the ``--comment-id`` the
command already requires, and cannot be forgotten.

Being unforgettable is not enough on its own, because the id is still the
model's to supply. A numeric comment id, a truncated node id, or the id of a
neighbouring comment all produce a marker that matches nothing, which is the
same runaway by a slower road. ``--comment-id`` is therefore checked against the
requests the forge reports as unanswered at that moment, and a mismatch fails
before anything is posted.

Why ``poll`` carries the whole thread and not just the triggers
---------------------------------------------------------------
Being addressed is what *wakes* the agent; it is not the whole of what it needs
to read. "Why this value?" is only answerable against the discussion that
preceded it, and two reviewers may have settled the question between themselves
before anyone typed ``/agent``. So every comment on the pull request travels
with the requests, whether or not it addressed the agent and whether or not its
author has write access — ``is_request``, ``is_self`` and ``can_write`` mark
each one so the worker can weigh it.

That widens what reaches the model: a comment from an account with no write
access is now in the prompt even though it can never be acted on. It is
context, never instruction, and the SKILL.md says so in the terms the model
reads. The trust decision stays exactly where it was — on ``can_write`` of the
comment that did the addressing.

Reply bodies are confined to ``/opt/data/scratch`` by the same ``realpath``
check ``resolver.handle_transition`` uses. The body is posted publicly, so the
path it comes from is bounded rather than merely checked for existence.

    The sweep decides who may be acted for, and it decides it twice over:
    `can_write` for the permission, `can_write_known` for whether the lookup
    answered at all. Nothing re-checked either at post time, so the whole trust
    boundary of this feature was a paragraph of prose in Step 2 of the
    SKILL.md. `poll` hands the worker every comment on the pull request, from
    every author, precisely so it can see the untrusted ones — which means the
    text arguing it should answer anyway is *in the prompt*, next to the row
    saying it must not. A model that misreads one row, or is talked into it by
    the comment it is reading, posts a real answer under the agent's identity
    to an account with no write access to the repository. That is a decision
    this file can check, so it checks it.

    Three rules, and which of them a refusal is subject to is the whole subtlety
    of this function.

    **Write access gates `reply` only.** `refuse` posts no answer and takes no
    action; it declines a request and stamps the marker that stops it being
    handed back every ten minutes. Step 2 of the SKILL.md sends the worker to it
    for exactly the case gated here, and for a trusted reviewer's out-of-scope
    ask too. Blocking a refusal is how a request loops forever, so the
    conservative verdict stays available from either side of that gate.

    **An unanswered permission lookup gates both.** Unknown is not permission,
    and a `reply` on it is the same public post on the same unverified account.
    But a *refusal* on it is worse, and it is the one mistake here that cannot
    be taken back: `agent-refused` closes the request for good, so a proxy
    timeout would silence a maintainer permanently and no later sweep would
    re-open it. The sweep holds these for the next tick rather than refusing
    them, says so in as many words, and this now holds them too. The
    close-the-loop failure the paragraph above guards against does not apply,
    because the request is not being declined — it is being left for a tick when
    the lookup works.

    **The per-pull-request refusal budget gates a refusal of an untrusted
    account.** The sweep stops at `pr_triggers.max_refusals_per_pr()` so that a
    hundred comments from an account with no write access cannot become a
    hundred public comments from the agent. Those requests are dropped without a
    marker, which means they are still unanswered — so `poll` kept handing them
    back, and the next card any trusted reviewer filed had the worker post the
    refusals the sweep had already declined to. Counting here is what makes the
    budget one budget. A refusal of a *trusted* reviewer is not counted against
    it: that is an answer to somebody entitled to one, and the amplification the
    budget exists to stop needs an account that can comment without limit.

    A reply saying "I have bumped the replica count to 2" is checkable, and
    checking it is the difference between a wrong answer and a lie the thread
    keeps. It matters more here than it would elsewhere: the reply is stamped
    `agent-answered`, so the request is closed for good and no later sweep
    re-opens it. Observed live — a worker whose `prepare` step was blocked
    reported both edits as made, stamped the marker, and left a branch still
    holding the old values with nothing to notice it.

    So `reply` makes the model say which world it is in — `--verify-commit
    <sha>` or `--no-change` — and this checks the first against the forge. The
    second is not verifiable here and is not pretended to be; what it buys is
    that a false claim now has to survive the model asserting the opposite one
    line above it, and it leaves that assertion in the command history.

    The two worlds are two flags, not one value. They shared a `dest` once, so
    `--no-change` was `--verify-commit ""` — and therefore `--verify-commit ""`
    was `--no-change`: an empty shell variable, or a `--jq` that returned
    nothing because the branch had no commits yet, satisfied `required=True`,
    skipped every check, and posted the claim. Every other malformed sha fails
    loudly; that one input failed silently, in the unsafe direction, which is
    the one shape this whole check exists to make impossible.

    On the branch is not enough, which is the second bound. Every commit the
    agent ever pushed is on the branch, including the one that opened the pull
    request — so a model that answers "done, see abc1234" while having changed
    nothing passes the membership test by naming its own earlier work. That is
    not a hypothetical: it is the same live failure recorded above, one step
    later, and the check as first written would not have caught it. So the
    commit must also postdate the request it claims to answer. `requested_at`
    is the triggering comment's `created_at`, which the caller already holds
    from the pending-request row it validated `--comment-id` against.
