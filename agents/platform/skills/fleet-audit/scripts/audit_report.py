audit_report.py — Deterministic reporting harness for the fleet-audit skill.

Every autonomous audit watchdog (compliance, security patch, obtainability,
cost, consistency drift, AI workload security) funnels its findings through
this script. Each audit
stream owns exactly ONE open GitHub **issue** — its ledger — rewritten in place
on every run and closed as completed when the fleet comes back clean. Fixes
travel separately, as narrow remediation pull requests carrying only the files
that fix a specific group of findings, so a report is never a pull request with
no diff. The LLM's role is strictly constrained to **inspecting the fleet
read-only and emitting a findings.json**; every git/gh operation, every rendered
body, the commit subjects, the timestamps, and the run-over-run delta are
produced here, deterministically.

Two-command lifecycle, plus one on-demand command:

    audit_report.py start     --audit <audit-id>
    audit_report.py finish    --audit <audit-id> --findings-file <path> [--dry-run]
    audit_report.py remediate --audit <audit-id> --findings-file <path>
                          --finding <id> [--finding <id>...] [--dry-run]

The pure functions (validate/render/delta) carry no I/O and are unit tested in
test_audit_report.py; the thin shell below them owns all subprocess execution.

    """What a stream is called, which SOP defines it, and every check in it.

    `checks` is the roster: the backticked slug in each `####` check heading of
    the stream's SOP, in SOP order. It exists so the harness can tell an audit
    that *ran* from one that merely *finished*. Without it, "I evaluated eleven
    checks against three clusters and found nothing" and "I read the first page
    of the SOP, enumerated the fleet, and stopped" produce byte-identical
    documents — both a populated `scope.clusters` and an empty `findings`, both
    published as a confident all-clear. That is not hypothetical: it is how five
    streams reported a clean fleet on a fleet that was not.

    `sop` is the filename under `agents/platform/governance/`. The validator
    names it when it rejects a slug, because the roster itself must never appear
    in an error message — see `_reject_unknown_check`.

    `test_check_rosters_match_the_sops` re-derives `checks` from the SOP
    headings, so a check added to an SOP without being added here fails CI
    rather than becoming a check no run is ever required to perform.

    `derived` names slugs a finding may cite but no cluster is ever asked to
    run. They are the streams' meta-findings — a conclusion drawn *across*
    facets rather than a check performed against one — so they belong in the
    set a `finding.check` is validated against but not in the coverage
    denominator, where they would read as a check nobody performed and hold the
    ledger open forever. `fleet-consistency-drift`'s split-cluster guard is the
    standing example: it fires when a cluster is an outlier on six or more
    facets, which is not something you can run against a cluster in isolation.

# not sound: the schemes that shipped happened to be distinguishable, but the

    the allowance and leave `…deployment-api` and `…deployment-web` both
    truncated to `d`, which is a collision, which is two findings sharing one
    row in the ledger. Longest-first keeps the segments near-equal, so identity
    degrades evenly instead of falling off one end.

    Longest-first narrows the collision window; it does not close it. Two

    a function of the finding alone: the same object derives the same short id
    next week whatever else that run's document happens to contain. That is

    Every string it accepts still becomes a real path, and on a real filesystem

    `/remediate` is the one place in this harness where a human overrules the

    hypothetical. The audit agent reads the ledger it has just written, finds a
    header telling the reader to comment `/remediate all`, and — holding the
    same credentials that open and merge pull requests — does exactly that.
    Three times on one issue, six minutes apart, each retry prompted by the

    holding: the App in question does have write access — it opens pull
    requests on this repository and merges them. Naming the machine directly is
    the difference between a gate and a lucky quirk of an API field.

      operator who runs this audit under their own token authors comments as
      themselves, and their `/remediate` has to keep working. An App's does
      not, because an App never carries the association.

    A machine's command is ignored in silence rather than refused. A refusal

    the cap: a human asked for that one by name.

    function nothing carried them for an existing one — a later run reads that
    pull request, decides it is already open, and moves on without looking at
    what its labels have become. They drift two ways.

    A reviewer strips them while triaging — which is exactly what happened to
    pull requests 34, 35 and 36 in the reference installation, and no later run
    put them back, so three pull requests the audit still owned stopped
    appearing under `agent:audit` for good. And `severity:` is recomputed from
    the findings the group currently holds, so a finding that escalates from
    minor to critical otherwise keeps the label it was opened with — the one
    field triage sorts on, silently stale.

    A second call rather than more flags on `open_remediation_pr`'s own
    `gh pr edit`, and `check=False`, because a label is worth less than the body
    it would otherwise take down with it: on a repository whose labels someone
    deleted by hand, folding these into the first call would abort the entire

    that do not apply resolves even when the pull request never carried them —
    `ensure_labels` creates all three at the top of every path that reaches
    here, and `gh` only objects to a label the *repository* does not have.

    One `gh` call sets all six, so a single unresolvable name applies *none* of
    them. That is the right trade against a partly-labelled pull request, but it
    is only safe if it is audible: a silent no-op here looks exactly like a
    refresh that had nothing to change, and the labelling gap this function

    describes, because its only caller cannot be reached with an open pull
    request. `promotion_candidates` diverts a finding whose pull request is
    OPEN into `already_open` and never promotes it, and
    `reconcile_remediation_prs` hands every finding in a group the *same* pull
    request — so a newly-appeared sibling finding cannot drag the group into
    `open_remediation_pr` either. Both halves were measured against the
    reference installation, not inferred: `/remediate` on the finding that owned
    pull request 103 reported `already_open`, and so did a second finding added
    to that same path.

    Every open pull request the run reconciled, rather than only the ones a
    `/remediate` named. `already_open` holds requested ids and nothing else, so
    hanging this off it would repair a pull request only in the run where
    somebody asked for it again — and the pull requests this exists for are
    precisely the ones nobody is asking about. A stripped label has to heal on
    the next scheduled audit or it does not heal.

    Labels and nothing else: no force-push, no rewritten body. That is what
    makes this safe from here. Leaving an open pull request alone is a
    deliberate promise — a reviewer's commits stay where they are — and
    re-labelling keeps it while still repairing the field triage sorts on. When

    The branch is never deleted: if the finding returns, the audit pushes to it
