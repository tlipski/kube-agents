# SOP: Upgrade & Patch Readiness Audit (Weekly Governance)

**Cron id:** `security-patch-orchestrator` — `20 7 * * 1` (Mondays, 07:20 UTC).

**Purpose:** Report whether every GKE cluster in the fleet runs a version its release channel still offers, and whether it is configured to _stay_ current on its own. This audit is **read-only and reports readiness**. It never upgrades anything: upgrading is a human decision, and the audit's job is to make that decision cheap, evidence-backed, and repeatable week over week.

**Data sources:** `gcloud container ...`, read-only `kubectl`, the `gke` MCP server, and the `platform_control` MCP tools (`list_cc_pods`, `get_cc_pod_diagnostics`, `list_cc_healthchecks`, `get_cc_operator_status`, `audit_log_searcher`). **Nothing else.** No BigQuery, no Prometheus, no Container Analysis or Artifact Registry vulnerability scanning, no Security Command Center, no external blueprint or CVE feed, and no delegation to Cluster Agents via kanban. **You have no vulnerability feed, so you never enumerate CVEs** — every finding here is version currency or upgrade-policy hygiene, and must be worded that way.

## Execution Checklist

### 0. Open the audit run

```bash
./skills/fleet-audit/scripts/audit_report.py start --audit security-patch-orchestrator
```

Returns `{"issue": <int|null>, "repo":"org/repo", "workspace":"/opt/data/gitops/security-patch-orchestrator/org__repo", "findings_path":"/opt/data/scratch/findings_security-patch-orchestrator.json", "pending_remediation_requests":[…]}`. Keep `findings_path` and `workspace`. The audit pod does not start inside a git checkout: `start` clones the GitOps repository to `workspace` itself, and that clone is where every `remediation.path` in step 4 is resolved and where every grep for an existing declaration belongs. `start` creates and resets no branch; there is no report branch. `issue` is this stream's open ledger issue, or `null` when it has none — either way you never create it. `pending_remediation_requests` lists finding ids a repo writer asked for with a `/remediate` comment on the ledger; write the manifest for each of those in step 4. The helper owns all git/`gh` work and renders the ledger issue body and every remediation PR body — **never hand-write a body, never run `git commit`/`gh issue create`/`gh pr create`/`gh issue comment` yourself.** **Never comment on the ledger yourself:** `/remediate` is a human reviewer's instruction to this harness, not a step in the audit, and an agent that posts it — including when someone asks for a fix in chat — is authorizing its own pull request. `finish` ignores a `/remediate` from a machine account, so posting one achieves nothing but noise on the issue.

### 1. Enumerate the target fleet

1. Resolve the project scope: `gcloud config get-value project`. If `gcloud projects list --format="value(projectId)"` succeeds, include every additional project where `gcloud container clusters list` returns at least one cluster.
2. Snapshot each project once — `clusters list` returns the **full** Cluster resources, node pools included, so one call is the whole inventory:
   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters list --project=<project> --format=json
   ```
3. Record every cluster you audit in `scope.clusters` as `{name, location, project, checks_run}`, plus an optional non-empty `limitations` string when some checks did not run or do not apply there. `scope.clusters` must be non-empty; if the fleet is genuinely empty, that is a hard failure of discovery, not a clean run — stop and report the error rather than emitting an empty scope.

   **`checks_run` is mandatory on every cluster,** and each entry is an object, never a bare string:

   ```json
   {
     "check": "no-maintenance-window",
     "command": "gcloud container clusters describe prod-usc1 --location us-central1 --project acme-prod --format='value(maintenancePolicy.window)'"
   }
   ```

   `check` is the backticked slug from the §3 heading that defines it — `master-behind`, `no-maintenance-window`, and so on — never the section number and never prose. (`start` prints the full roster of ten; the SOP still says what each check _is_.) `command` is the literal invocation you issued on that cluster for that check, with its `--location`/`--project` or `--context`. It must name one of `kubectl`, `gcloud`, `gsutil`, `bq`, `helm`, or `curl`; `echo`, `cat`, `python3 -c`, and a call back into `audit_report.py` are all rejected, as is anything under eight characters.

   The validator rejects an unknown slug, a duplicate, a missing or unusable command, the field being absent, and an empty list unless that cluster's `limitations` says why nothing ran: a cluster you could read but ran nothing against is not a clean cluster, it is an audit that did not happen. Anything short of the checks that apply to that cluster makes the run **partial** exactly as a `limitations` note does, so the ledger stays open and nothing is announced as resolved. Append the entry when its check completes, not when you intend to run it, and paste the command rather than reconstructing it — every one is published verbatim in the ledger under _How this run checked the fleet_.

   **A check the cluster's shape rules out is not a gap — declare it.** Alongside `checks_run`, a cluster may carry `checks_not_applicable` as a list of `{check, reason}`:

   ```json
   {
     "check": "pool-skew",
     "reason": "GKE Autopilot: Google manages the node pools, there are none to skew."
   }
   ```

   Same slugs as `checks_run`, and the `reason` must say why the check _cannot_ apply here — "N/A" and "not applicable" are rejected; name the property of the cluster that rules it out. Those checks leave the denominator instead of counting as missing, so an Autopilot cluster reads as complete at six of six rather than forever-incomplete at six of ten. This matters more here than anywhere: on a fleet that is mostly Autopilot, without it every run is partial forever, `resolved` is pinned at `0`, the ledger can never close, and no stale remediation PR is ever cleaned up. Use it only for checks the cluster's shape rules out. A check you could have run and did not is a `limitations` note and a real gap, and the validator rejects a slug in both lists, a duplicate, an unknown slug, and a reason under sixteen characters.

4. **One question decides the scope list.** A cluster appears in exactly one scope list. Could you read it? Yes → `scope.clusters`; if some checks did not run there, name them in that cluster's `limitations`. No → `scope.skipped`. Nothing goes in both, and nothing in `scope.skipped` may appear in a finding. The validator rejects a document whose two lists overlap, and any finding whose `cluster` names a `scope.skipped` entry.
5. Record every cluster you could **not** read in `scope.skipped` with a specific reason. Skip, do not flag:
   - `status` is `PROVISIONING`, `STOPPING`, or `ERROR` — the object is mid-flight or broken; version data is meaningless.
   - `enableKubernetesAlpha: true` — alpha clusters cannot be upgraded and auto-expire by design.
   - A project that errors on list (permission, API disabled). Record it as `{"cluster": "<project>/*", "reason": "…"}`.
6. Record every cluster you **could** read but could not fully check in `scope.clusters`, with the gap in its `limitations`. Autopilot (`autopilot.enabled: true`) is the standard case and is **never** skipped: Google manages those node pools, so run 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8, 3.10 there and declare the four node-pool checks inapplicable rather than missing —

   ```json
   {
     "name": "<name>",
     "location": "<loc>",
     "project": "<p>",
     "checks_run": [{ "check": "master-behind", "command": "…" }],
     "checks_not_applicable": [
       {
         "check": "pool-skew",
         "reason": "GKE Autopilot: Google manages the node pools; no user-managed pool to skew."
       },
       {
         "check": "no-autoupgrade",
         "reason": "GKE Autopilot: node auto-upgrade is enforced by Google and not configurable."
       },
       {
         "check": "no-autorepair",
         "reason": "GKE Autopilot: node auto-repair is enforced by Google and not configurable."
       },
       {
         "check": "stale-image-type",
         "reason": "GKE Autopilot: Google selects the node image; the operator cannot choose one."
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   — which leaves the cluster fully covered at six of six instead of dragging every run into partial coverage. Do not also name those four in `limitations`; that is the field for a check that could have run here and did not. Skipping the cluster outright would suppress every cluster-scoped finding you did prove there.

### 2. Establish the version baseline

Fetch the server config **once per distinct location** and cache it in memory. Do not refetch per cluster — a 40-cluster fleet in 4 regions makes 4 calls, not 40.

```bash
gcloud container get-server-config --location=<location> --project=<project> --format=json
```

Use `channels[]` (each entry: `channel`, `defaultVersion`, `validVersions[]`, and `upgradeTargetVersion` where present), plus `validMasterVersions[]`, `validNodeVersions[]`, and `validImageTypes[]`. If you are unsure whether a field exists in your gcloud version, inspect the raw `--format=json` output before relying on it — never assert a field you have not seen.

**Version comparison rule (use this everywhere, no exceptions).** Parse `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-gke.BUILD` into the integer 4-tuple `(MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH, BUILD)`; a version with no `-gke.N` suffix gets `BUILD = 0` (`1.30.5-gke.1355000` → `(1,30,5,1355000)`). Compare tuples element-wise as integers. **Never string-compare GKE versions** — lexically `"1.30.9" > "1.30.10"`, which is wrong — and never compare `-gke.BUILD` across different patch levels. `minor(v) = (MAJOR, MINOR)`; "N minors behind" is the difference in the second element when the first elements match, and any difference in the first element is unbounded skew.

**Universal suppression gates.** Before emitting _any_ version-drift finding (3.1, 3.2, 3.3), drop it if the cluster `status` is `RECONCILING` or the node pool `status` is `RECONCILING`/`PROVISIONING` — that is an upgrade in progress, and reporting it is noise. Policy checks (3.4–3.10) read stable configuration and still run against a `RECONCILING` cluster.

**Confirm before you emit.** The `clusters list` snapshot finds candidates; it does not justify them. For every finding, re-run a targeted, copy-pasteable command that isolates the offending field, and record _that literal command_ in `evidence.command` with its output in `evidence.excerpt`, trimmed to the 40 lines / 2000 characters the helper keeps and centred on the value that triggered the flag. **A finding you cannot reproduce is dropped, not softened.** Prefer gcloud's own `--format` projections over shell post-processing; do not assume `jq` is installed.

**Never paste a credential into an excerpt.** `clusters describe` returns `masterAuth` — client certificates, client keys, and any basic-auth password — and a service-account key can appear in a node config. None of that goes in `evidence.excerpt`. Re-run with a `--format="value(...)"` projection naming only the field you flagged, or a `-o jsonpath` that omits the secret. The harness redacts high-confidence credential shapes as a backstop, not as the primary control.

**Finding identity.** **Do not write an `id`.** The harness derives it from `check`, `cluster`, `namespace` and `object`, and ignores any `id` in the file. `check` is the backticked token in the check's heading below; a slug outside this SOP's roster is rejected. All findings here are cluster-scoped, so `namespace` is always `""`.

That leaves `object` carrying the whole distinction between one node pool and the next, so a per-pool finding must name the pool — `NodePool/<pool>`, not `Cluster/<cluster>`, or every pool in the cluster collapses into one finding and the harness refuses the document. A cluster-wide check names `Cluster/<cluster>`. **Never embed a version string, timestamp, date, or count in `object`**: the same problem must keep the same identity across weeks, or the new/resolved delta is worthless — and worse than worthless, because a problem that changes identity is announced as fixed.

The project is deliberately not part of the identity. Two clusters sharing a name across two projects cannot be told apart by any of these fields, so the harness rejects a scope that contains both; audit those projects in separate runs.

### 3. Checks

#### 3.1 Control plane behind its release-channel baseline (`master-behind`)

- **Command:** `gcloud container clusters describe <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --format="value(currentMasterVersion,releaseChannel.channel)"`
- **Flag when:** let `C` = `releaseChannel.channel` and `B` = the cached `channels[]` entry for `C`. (a) `currentMasterVersion` is absent from `B.validVersions[]` — or, for a cluster with no channel, absent from `validMasterVersions[]`. (b) `minor(currentMasterVersion) < minor(B.defaultVersion)`. (c) same minor, but the full tuple is below `B.defaultVersion`.
- **Do NOT flag:** a master _newer_ than `defaultVersion` (channel rollout waves are staged, and RAPID's newest is routinely ahead of its default); a master that equals `defaultVersion`; a master merely below `max(validVersions)` — `defaultVersion` is the rollout target, `max()` is not.
- **Severity:** (a) **critical** — the version is no longer offered at this location, so it is outside the supported window and cannot be patched in place. (b) **major**. (c) **minor**.
- **Impact:** "Control plane `<v>` is no longer offered in the `<C>` channel at `<loc>`; the cluster is outside the supported window and receives no further patches."
- **Remediation:** `kind: gcloud`, human-executed — `gcloud container clusters upgrade <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --master --cluster-version=<B.defaultVersion>`. When the jump crosses more than one minor, use `kind: manual` instead and state that GKE upgrades one minor at a time, so the path runs through each intermediate minor.

#### 3.2 Node-pool version skew against the control plane (`pool-skew`)

- **Command:** `gcloud container node-pools describe <pool> --cluster=<cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --format="value(version,status)"`
- **Flag when:** compare each `nodePools[].version` against `currentMasterVersion`. Major versions differ or the pool is **≥ 3 minors** behind; the pool is exactly **2 minors** behind; the pool is exactly **1 minor** behind; the pool is on the same minor but an older `(PATCH, BUILD)`. Separately, flag a pool whose version is **ahead of** the control plane — GKE never produces that state, so it signals a broken or hand-edited pool.
- **Do NOT flag:** Autopilot clusters (Google owns those pools; step 1 records that in `checks_not_applicable`, never in `limitations`, and the cluster is still in `scope.clusters`); a pool `RECONCILING`/`PROVISIONING`, or a cluster `RECONCILING`; a pool one patch behind the control plane while the cluster is mid-rollout. GKE upgrades the control plane first and drains pools afterwards, so transient one-patch lag is normal operation.
- **Severity:** ≥ 3 minors or major mismatch → **critical** (outside GKE's documented skew policy: nodes may be no more than two minor versions behind the control plane). Exactly 2 minors → **major** (at the ceiling — the next control-plane minor upgrade is blocked until the pool moves). Exactly 1 minor → **major** if `management.autoUpgrade` is `false`, else **minor**. Patch-only drift → **minor**. Pool ahead of control plane → **major**.
- **Impact:** "Node pool `<pool>` runs `<v>`, `<n>` minor versions behind control plane `<m>` — at or beyond GKE's two-minor skew ceiling, which blocks the cluster's next control-plane upgrade."
- **Remediation:** `kind: gcloud` — `gcloud container clusters upgrade <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --node-pool=<pool> --cluster-version=<currentMasterVersion>`.

#### 3.3 Fleet-wide minor-version spread (`fleet-spread`)

- **Command:** `gcloud container clusters list --project=<p> --format="table(name,location,currentMasterVersion,releaseChannel.channel)"`
- **Flag when:** the set of distinct `minor(currentMasterVersion)` across all audited clusters spans **≥ 2 minors** (newest minor minus oldest minor ≥ 2). Emit exactly **one** finding, attached to the single most out-of-date cluster, with `object: "Cluster/<laggard>"`; name the full spread in the title and impact.
- **Do NOT flag:** a one-minor spread (normal for a fleet split across RAPID/REGULAR/STABLE); spread caused only by clusters already skipped in step 1; a second finding per laggard cluster — one fleet finding, always.
- **Severity:** **minor** — this is a fleet-consistency signal, and each individual laggard is already reported by 3.1.
- **Impact:** "The fleet spans `<oldest>`–`<newest>`, `<n>` minor versions wide; API-compatibility testing and rollout playbooks must cover every one of them."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manual` — note which clusters sit on the oldest minor and that consolidating them onto one channel narrows the spread.

#### 3.4 Cluster not enrolled in a release channel (`no-channel`)

**This audit owns upgrade-policy hygiene** — release-channel enrolment (here), node-pool auto-upgrade (3.5), and the maintenance window (3.7). The Fleet Consistency Drift audit defers those three to it and keeps only the half this audit does not cover: which of two _real_ channels a cluster sits on relative to its cohort (its §4.1). Enrolment is an absolute question with a right answer; which channel is a cohort question, and only one stream answers each.

- **Command:** `gcloud container clusters describe <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --format="value(releaseChannel.channel)"`
- **Flag when:** the field is empty, absent, or `UNSPECIFIED` — the cluster is pinned to a static version and receives **no** automatic control-plane patches.
- **Do NOT flag:** any cluster reporting `RAPID`, `REGULAR`, `STABLE`, or `EXTENDED`. Autopilot clusters are always enrolled, so this check should never fire on them.
- **Severity:** **major** — nothing is broken today, but the cluster has opted out of the mechanism that keeps it patched, so every future patch is manual work someone must remember.
- **Impact:** "`<cluster>` is on a static version with no release channel; it will not receive automatic control-plane security patches."
- **Remediation:** `kind: gcloud` — `gcloud container clusters update <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --release-channel=regular`. If the cluster is managed as a Config Connector `ContainerCluster` in the working tree, use `kind: manifest` instead (see step 4).

#### 3.5 Node-pool auto-upgrade disabled (`no-autoupgrade`)

- **Command:** `gcloud container node-pools describe <pool> --cluster=<cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --format="value(management.autoUpgrade)"`
- **Flag when:** `management.autoUpgrade` is `false` or absent.
- **Do NOT flag:** Autopilot clusters; pools in a cluster already skipped in step 1.
- **Severity:** **major** — the pool will drift out of the skew window on its own and eventually block the control plane.
- **Impact:** "Node pool `<pool>` has auto-upgrade disabled; its nodes will fall behind the control plane until someone upgrades them by hand."
- **Remediation:** `kind: gcloud` — `gcloud container node-pools update <pool> --cluster=<cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --enable-autoupgrade`; or `kind: manifest` when the pool is a Config Connector `ContainerNodePool`.

#### 3.6 Node-pool auto-repair disabled (`no-autorepair`)

- **Command:** `gcloud container node-pools describe <pool> --cluster=<cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --format="value(management.autoRepair)"`
- **Flag when:** `management.autoRepair` is `false` or absent.
- **Do NOT flag:** Autopilot clusters; pools in a cluster already skipped in step 1.
- **Severity:** **minor** — an availability and node-hygiene gap rather than a patch-currency gap.
- **Impact:** "Node pool `<pool>` has auto-repair disabled; unhealthy nodes stay in the pool until an operator notices."
- **Remediation:** `kind: gcloud` — `gcloud container node-pools update <pool> --cluster=<cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --enable-autorepair`.

#### 3.7 No maintenance window configured (`no-maintenance-window`)

- **Command:** `gcloud container clusters describe <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --format="json(maintenancePolicy)"`
- **Flag when:** neither `maintenancePolicy.window.dailyMaintenanceWindow` nor `maintenancePolicy.window.recurringWindow` is present. Without a window, GKE may start automatic upgrades at any hour.
- **Do NOT flag:** a window that exists but looks narrow or awkwardly timed — that is an operator's deliberate choice, not a defect; a cluster skipped in step 1.
- **Severity:** **minor** — upgrades still happen, just at an uncontrolled time.
- **Impact:** "`<cluster>` has no maintenance window; automatic upgrades can begin during business hours."
- **Remediation:** `kind: gcloud` — `gcloud container clusters update <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --maintenance-window-start=<RFC3339> --maintenance-window-end=<RFC3339> --maintenance-window-recurrence="FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA,SU"`.

#### 3.8 Upgrade-blocking maintenance exclusion (`blocking-exclusion`)

- **Command:** `gcloud container clusters describe <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --format="json(maintenancePolicy.window.maintenanceExclusions)"`
- **Flag when:** an exclusion is **currently in effect** (`startTime ≤ now ≤ endTime`, comparing epoch seconds via `date -u -d '<ts>' +%s` against `date -u +%s`) **and** its `maintenanceExclusionOptions.scope` blocks upgrades (`NO_UPGRADES` or `NO_MINOR_OR_NODE_UPGRADES`), **and** either it ends more than 30 days from now or the cluster already carries a critical/major finding from 3.1 or 3.2.
- **Do NOT flag:** expired exclusions; exclusions that start in the future; short freeze windows (< 30 days) on a cluster with no outstanding version finding — a holiday freeze is legitimate operational practice; `NO_MINOR_UPGRADES` scope, which still permits patch upgrades.
- **Severity:** **major** when it is holding back a cluster with a critical/major version finding, otherwise **minor**.
- **Impact:** "Maintenance exclusion `<name>` (scope `<scope>`, until `<endTime>`) is currently suppressing upgrades on `<cluster>`, which is already behind its channel baseline."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manual` — name the exclusion and its end date, and state that a human must decide whether to shorten it or accept the delay. Do not propose deleting an exclusion automatically.

#### 3.9 Deprecated or unoffered node image variant (`stale-image-type`)

- **Command:** `gcloud container node-pools describe <pool> --cluster=<cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --format="value(config.imageType)"`
- **Flag when:** `config.imageType` is absent from the cached `validImageTypes[]` for that location, **or** it is exactly `COS`, `UBUNTU`, or `WINDOWS_SAC` — the pre-containerd and deprecated-servicing variants.
- **Do NOT flag:** any image type present in `validImageTypes[]` and not on the deprecated list (`COS_CONTAINERD`, `UBUNTU_CONTAINERD`, `WINDOWS_LTSC_CONTAINERD`, and whatever else that location currently offers); Autopilot clusters; casing differences — compare case-insensitively.
- **Severity:** **major** — a node image the location no longer offers cannot receive node-image patches and blocks future upgrades.
- **Impact:** "Node pool `<pool>` runs image type `<t>`, which `<loc>` no longer offers; the pool cannot take node-image patches."
- **Remediation:** `kind: gcloud` — `gcloud container clusters upgrade <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --node-pool=<pool> --image-type=<target>`. Image type changes go through `clusters upgrade`, not `node-pools update`; confirm the flag with `gcloud container clusters upgrade --help` before recording it.
- **`<target>` is per pool, read off the pool's own observed image type. Never hardcode it.** Emitting `COS_CONTAINERD` for an Ubuntu or a Windows pool is not a runtime migration, it is a node-OS replacement, and it will be applied verbatim by whoever pastes the command:

  | Observed `config.imageType` | `--image-type` to emit    | What the move is                                                                             |
  | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `COS`                       | `COS_CONTAINERD`          | Docker → containerd on the same OS.                                                          |
  | `UBUNTU`                    | `UBUNTU_CONTAINERD`       | Docker → containerd on the same OS.                                                          |
  | `WINDOWS_SAC`               | `WINDOWS_LTSC_CONTAINERD` | Also a servicing-channel change (SAC → LTSC); say so in the note and have the owner confirm. |

  For the other trigger — an image type absent from `validImageTypes[]` that is not one of these three — there is no derivable target: emit `kind: manual`, name the image types `validImageTypes[]` actually offers at that location, and leave the choice to the pool's owner.

#### 3.10 Upgrade notifications not configured (`no-notifications`)

- **Command:** `gcloud container clusters describe <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --format="json(notificationConfig)"`
- **Flag when:** `notificationConfig.pubsub.enabled` is `false` or absent, or it is enabled but `notificationConfig.pubsub.filter.eventType[]` is set and excludes the upgrade-available event. Confirm the exact enum spelling in the raw JSON before quoting it — do not assert an enum you have not seen in output.
- **Do NOT flag:** Pub/Sub enabled with no `filter` block at all (an absent filter means _all_ event types are delivered); a pool with `management.upgradeOptions.autoUpgradeStartTime` set — that is GKE having already scheduled an upgrade, which is the system working. Attach that scheduled time to the cluster's other findings as context instead.
- **Severity:** **minor** — a visibility gap; the fleet learns about available upgrades only when this audit runs.
- **Impact:** "`<cluster>` publishes no GKE upgrade notifications, so upgrade-available signals reach no one between weekly audits."
- **Remediation:** `kind: gcloud` — `gcloud container clusters update <cluster> --location=<loc> --project=<p> --notification-config=pubsub=ENABLED,pubsub-topic=projects/<p>/topics/<topic>`; verify the flag's filter syntax with `--help` before recording it.

**Deliberately not checked.** State these in the ledger only if asked; never fabricate coverage. CVE enumeration and image vulnerability scanning are **dropped** — they need Container Analysis, Artifact Registry scanning, or an external feed, all forbidden. Calendar end-of-life ("this minor goes EOL in 45 days") is **dropped** — GKE exposes no EOL date in the API and a support-window calendar would be an external input; 3.1's "absent from `validVersions[]`" is the closest tool-derivable proxy and is what the audit actually reports. In-cluster component versions and workload image tags are out of scope: this audit covers GKE control planes and node pools.

### 4. Generate remediation artifacts

Choose `kind` by who owns the object. Grep the `workspace` clone for the cluster's Config Connector manifest (`grep -rl "name: <cluster>" --include='*.yaml' <workspace>`): if it is managed declaratively, a `gcloud` fix would be reverted on the next reconcile, so emit `kind: manifest`; otherwise emit `kind: gcloud`. Use `kind: manual` only when no single command closes the finding. **Never trust that grep unopened.** `grep` is kind-blind and unanchored, so `name: <cluster>` also matches every `app.kubernetes.io/name:` label line and every object whose name merely starts with the cluster's — open each hit and confirm it is a `ContainerCluster` or `ContainerNodePool` declaring the cluster you flagged before you let it decide the kind. A false hit here is worse than a missed one: it sends the fix into a `manifest` PR against a file that governs nothing, and the real cluster stays unpatched while the ledger records a merge. Every remediation carries a `note`; **`path` is permitted only when `kind` is `manifest`** — setting it on a `gcloud` or `manual` remediation hard-fails the run. A `kind: gcloud` `note` is rendered into the ledger issue — and into the remediation PR if one ever exists — **inside a bash fence**, so it must be shell-pasteable: the command on its own line, and any caveat (a multi-minor path, a pool that will be drained and recreated, a flag whose syntax you confirmed with `--help`) as a `#` comment line above it. Prose in a `gcloud` note renders as broken shell; `kind: manual` notes are rendered as prose and should read as prose.

**Only a `manifest` finding can become a remediation PR.** Most of this audit is `gcloud` and `manual`, and those stay prose in the ledger for a human to run — a `/remediate` naming one is refused with a comment, because a PR with no diff is what this model exists to avoid. Every `/remediate` gets exactly one reply on the ledger and never a second: either an acknowledgement naming each finding it targeted and what happened to each, or a single refusal stating the reason — no write access, an id that is not in the current document, a target that is not a `manifest`, or a command not written at the start of its own line and so never parsed as one. A hidden marker records that the answer was given, so a standing request is not re-answered every morning. Of the manifest findings, `finish` promotes automatically only those at `critical` severity whose branch carries no **live** pull request — a PR the harness itself closed as stale is labelled `audit:stale-closed` and is eligible again, whereas a human's close and a merge are both final — at most five per run, and names in the ledger the ones it withheld; every other manifest finding waits for a repo writer to comment `/remediate <finding-id>` or `/remediate all`. In practice nothing here auto-promotes: this audit's `critical` findings (3.1a, 3.2) are `gcloud`, and the manifest-eligible checks top out at `major`, so every manifest ships on request. Write the manifest for each id in `pending_remediation_requests` from step 0 whose finding still reproduces, or its promotion fails for want of a file. Findings whose manifest paths intersect share a single PR.

For `kind: manifest`, **edit the Config Connector declaration the grep above found — do not write a new file.** Its POSIX path relative to the `workspace` root is the `remediation.path` (no leading `/` or `:`, no `..`, no glob metacharacters `*`, `?`, `[`, `]`), and the file must be on disk when `finish` runs. If it is not, the run does not die: that finding degrades to `kind: manual` with its evidence and recommendation intact and a line in the ledger saying the audit named the fix but never wrote it, and the report publishes without it. The report survives; the mergeable diff does not — so write the file. Rewrite it as the resource's **complete** desired manifest — every field it already carried, plus the one you are changing: `spec.management.autoUpgrade: true` (or `autoRepair: true`) on a `ContainerNodePool`, or `spec.releaseChannel.channel: REGULAR` or the `spec.maintenancePolicy.recurringWindow` block on a `ContainerCluster`. `apiVersion`, `metadata.name`, and `metadata.namespace` stay identical, so the diff is the one field. **Never emit a fragment carrying only `metadata.name` and the changed field, and never write a second file for a resource the repo already declares** — a fragment is not valid `kubectl apply` input, and two files claiming one object is a duplicate resource id that Config Sync and Argo both reject. If the grep finds no declaration, the object is not managed declaratively, so the remediation is `kind: gcloud` (or `kind: manual` where no single command closes it) and no file is written. This audit has no create case at all — every manifest here edits a declaration the grep already found. Should one ever be added, the new file belongs beside the Config Connector declarations already applied for that project, discovered from a sibling; **never a new top-level directory and never a parent directory that is not already in the clone**, because the repository is reconciled by a tool that applies a fixed set of paths and a file outside them is applied by nothing. Never generate a manifest that changes a cluster or node-pool **version** — version moves are the human's call and belong in `kind: gcloud`/`manual` notes.

### 5. Emit findings.json

Write the document to the `findings_path` from step 0 with `audit: "security-patch-orchestrator"` (it must match `--audit` exactly), the populated `scope.clusters`/`scope.skipped`, and the findings array — `[]` for a clean audit. Every finding needs a non-empty `check`, `severity`, `title`, `cluster`, `object`, `impact`, `evidence.command`, `recommendation`, and `remediation.kind`; `namespace` is `""` here, and no finding carries an `id` — the harness derives it (§2). Before writing, self-check: no two findings sharing a `(check, cluster, object)` triple, and no `object` carrying a version or a date; every `evidence.command` a literal command you actually ran; `remediation.path` set for and only for `kind: "manifest"`, and present on disk; `scope.clusters` non-empty, every entry carrying a `checks_run` list of `{check, command}` objects naming the §3 checks that actually ran on that cluster and the commands that ran them — never the full ten because the SOP lists ten — every entry's `limitations` non-empty where present, and every `scope.skipped` entry carrying both `cluster` and `reason`, with the two lists disjoint and no finding naming a skipped cluster. A schema violation publishes nothing — `finish` exits 2 and the ledger is untouched — so validate here rather than discover it there.

Read your `checks_run` lists once more before you write. Padding one to ten because §3 lists ten checks is the one entry in this document that converts a partial audit back into a false all-clear — the harness cannot see the check you skipped, so it takes the list at its word. The `command` on each entry is what makes that padding falsifiable rather than free: it is published verbatim, so an invented command is a false statement in a public issue. `checks_not_applicable` is the same lie wearing a different field: it removes checks from the denominator, so a slug parked there because you ran out of turns is a coverage gap the ledger will never show. It is published too — every exclusion and its reason render under _Not applicable_, where a reviewer who knows the cluster can call it. An honest six-of-ten costs you nothing but an open ledger, and an honest six-of-six on an Autopilot cluster closes it.

**`recommendation` is required on every finding.** Three sub-fields, all non-empty strings, no exceptions. Almost nothing in this audit is promotable, and that is precisely why: a `gcloud` finding a human runs by hand needs the argument for the fix more than a mergeable diff does, and the reasoning is only cheap while the evidence is in front of you.

- `action` — what to do, imperative, one or two sentences.
- `rationale` — why this fix and not the obvious alternative; name the alternative you considered and why you rejected it.
- `risk` — what breaks on apply, and the read-only check to run first.

Worked example, for a 3.5 finding on node pool `batch-a`:

```json
"recommendation": {
  "action": "Re-enable auto-upgrade on node pool batch-a with gcloud container node-pools update batch-a --cluster=prod-usc1 --location=us-central1 --project=acme-prod --enable-autoupgrade.",
  "rationale": "Auto-upgrade is the only mechanism that keeps this pool inside GKE's two-minor skew window without a human remembering to act. The obvious alternative — leaving it off and upgrading the pool by hand each quarter — is rejected because that is the process that already failed here; the pool is behind today.",
  "risk": "GKE will drain and recreate these nodes during the maintenance window, so workloads on the pool are evicted. Confirm the window is outside business hours first with gcloud container clusters describe prod-usc1 --location=us-central1 --project=acme-prod --format=\"json(maintenancePolicy)\"."
}
```

**Size budget.** The harness caps the rendered ledger body at 60,000 characters, trims each excerpt to 40 lines / 2,000 characters and each command to 2,000, and caps the scope tables at 60 rows. On a fleet large enough to overflow, the description is truncated from the least-severe end and says so, while the title's counts remain the true totals. Trim your own excerpts to the lines that prove the finding rather than leaving that to the clipper.

### 6. Close the audit run

```bash
./skills/fleet-audit/scripts/audit_report.py finish --audit security-patch-orchestrator \
  --findings-file /opt/data/scratch/findings_security-patch-orchestrator.json
```

One JSON line comes back with `status`, `issue_url`, `new`, `resolved`, `prs_opened`, `prs_closed`, `partial`, `coverage_gaps`, and `silent_ok`. Exit 2 means the validator rejected the document and nothing was published — fix the document, do not retry blind. Exit 1 is fatal. Exit 0 means it published.

**`partial` is the coverage flag.** It is `true` when any cluster landed in `scope.skipped` or any audited cluster carries a `limitations` note, and `coverage_gaps` lists those gaps as readable sentences. An upgrade audit that could not reach a cluster has no idea whether that cluster's node pools are still behind, so the harness will not let the run act as if it does: `resolved` is forced to `0` with no resolved-delta posted, no remediation PR is closed as stale, and even a findings-free run keeps the ledger open — `status: "CLEAN"`, but the issue stays and gains a comment naming the gaps. A check declared in `checks_not_applicable` is not a gap and does not raise the flag: it left the denominator, so an Autopilot cluster that ran everything that _can_ apply to it is a fully covered cluster. It is a coverage flag and nothing more: `true` if and only if `coverage_gaps` is non-empty. The step 5 size budget does not raise it, because a description that could not carry every finding still counted them all in the title and names in the body what it dropped.

**`silent_ok` decides silence. Do not re-derive it.** `finish` returns `silent_ok: true` only when this run moved nothing an operator needs to hear about: nothing new, nothing resolved, no coverage gap, no remediation PR opened or closed. Read the flag rather than reassembling that from `status`, `new`, `resolved`, and `partial` yourself — that arithmetic is where a run talks itself into silence it has not earned. Two rules, and they are the whole rule:

- On a **scheduled** run, `silent_ok: true` → your final response is **exactly** `[SILENT]`. Otherwise report, and every report carries `issue_url` in full.
- **An on-demand run is never silent.** If a person dispatched this job — from a kanban card or straight from chat — someone is waiting on the answer, and `[SILENT]` throws it away. Report the outcome and the ledger URL whatever `silent_ok` says.

What to report in each case:

- `silent_ok: true` → `[SILENT]` on a scheduled run, nothing else and no preamble. On `CLEAN` the helper commented, closed the ledger issue **as completed**, and closed every open remediation PR for this stream; on `UPDATED` the ledger was rewritten but nothing moved. Dispatched on demand, say which of those happened in one line and give the issue URL.
- `status: "CLEAN"` with `resolved: > 0` → the fleet is fully patched and no longer behind its channel. Report the issue URL and how many findings closed with it. On a patch audit this is the sentence someone has been waiting for, and silence would bury it.
- `status: "CLEAN"` with `partial: true` → nothing reproduced, but the ledger and its PRs stay open on incomplete coverage. One line reporting the clean result and the `coverage_gaps`, then the issue URL.
- Any other outcome → one line, then the issue URL. For example: `Upgrade & patch readiness: 3 new findings (1 critical), 2 resolved, across 11 clusters — <issue_url>`. Name any remediation PRs opened or closed in the same line.

## Red Lines

- **Never mutate.** No `gcloud container clusters upgrade`, `clusters update`, `node-pools update`, `kubectl apply/patch/delete`, or any write through the `gke` MCP server. Every remediation is a command for a human or a manifest in a remediation PR.
- **Never claim CVE coverage.** You have no vulnerability feed. "Unpatched", "vulnerable", and "CVE-XXXX" do not appear in your findings; "outside the supported window" and "behind the channel baseline" do.
- **Never invent a field.** If you have not seen a key in `--format=json` output on this fleet, do not reference it — inspect first, then assert.
- **Never emit an unreproducible finding.** No `evidence.command`, no finding.
- **Never write an unstable `object`.** The id is derived from `check`, `cluster`, `namespace`, and `object`, so an `object` that moves between runs destabilises it — a node pool named for the version it is currently on, or the pool one week and the cluster the next. Name the durable object the check judged. A finding whose identity moves is reported as fixed and re-reported as new, on a ledger people trust to tell them what is still outside the supported window.
- **Never hand-write the ledger issue body or a PR body, and never touch git/`gh` directly.** `audit_report.py` owns that surface: it creates and rewrites this stream's one ledger issue, and it opens, refreshes, and closes every remediation PR. Never open a second ledger issue, never open a remediation PR for a non-`manifest` finding, and never reopen a merged one.
- **Never paste a credential into evidence.** No `masterAuth` block, client key, token, or service-account key in an `evidence.excerpt`; re-read with a projection that omits it.
- **Never delegate to a Cluster Agent** or open kanban cards from this audit; it is a self-contained fleet read.
