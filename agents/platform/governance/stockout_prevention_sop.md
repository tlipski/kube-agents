# SOP: Fleet Stockout Prevention & Capacity Audit (Daily Governance)

**Purpose:** Sweep every managed GKE cluster and GCP region for capacity stockout vulnerabilities, fragile ComputeClass configurations, quota bottlenecks, and obtainability risks before workloads suffer scheduling outages. The question this audit answers for a platform admin is: _which workloads and compute classes on my fleet will fail to scale or encounter a capacity stockout during demand spikes or zonal hardware shortages?_ Output is this stream's single GitHub ledger issue, rewritten in place on every run, plus narrow remediation Pull Requests carrying generated manifests for the findings that get promoted.

**Cron:** id `stockout-prevention`, schedule `20 9 * * *` (daily 09:20 UTC). The id is a stable observability identifier and does not change.

**Data sources:** `kubectl` read verbs, `gcloud compute ...`, `gcloud container ...`, GCP reservations API (`gcloud compute reservations list`), Spot capacity advice APIs (`gcloud beta compute advice capacity`, `gcloud beta compute advice capacity-history`), and Cloud Logging autoscaler visibility logs (`container.googleapis.com/cluster-autoscaler-visibility`). **Nothing else** — no external blueprints, no manual assumptions. Every conclusion is derived from live cluster and cloud reads you performed in this run.

---

## Execution Checklist

### 0. Open the audit run

```bash
./skills/fleet-audit/scripts/audit_report.py start --audit stockout-prevention
```

Returns `{"issue": <int|null>, "repo":"org/repo", "workspace":"/opt/data/gitops/stockout-prevention/org__repo", "findings_path":"/opt/data/scratch/findings_stockout-prevention.json", "pending_remediation_requests":[…]}`. Keep `findings_path` and `workspace` from this call; you write into both.

- `workspace` is the GitOps clone `start` made for you. The audit pod does not begin life inside a checkout, so this is the only tree that exists, and every `remediation.path` in Step 4 is resolved against it — a manifest written elsewhere is one the harness cannot find.
- `issue` is this stream's open ledger issue, or `null` when it has none. Either way you never create it — `finish` owns that.
- `pending_remediation_requests` lists finding ids a repo writer asked for with a `/remediate` comment on the ledger. Write a manifest for each one while you inspect (Step 4), or the promotion fails for want of a file.
- `start` creates and resets no branch. There is no report branch.

The helper owns every `git`/`gh` operation and renders the ledger issue body and every remediation PR body — **never hand-write an issue or PR body, never run `git commit`, `git push`, `gh issue create`, `gh pr create`, or `gh issue comment` yourself.**

**Never comment on the ledger yourself.** `/remediate` is a human reviewer's instruction to this harness, not a step in the audit: an agent that posts it is authorizing its own pull request.

### 1. Enumerate the target fleet

```bash
gcloud container clusters list --format=json
```

- Target every cluster with `status == "RUNNING"`. Record `{name, location, project, checks_run}` into `scope.clusters`.
- Obtain per-cluster credentials into an isolated kubeconfig so clusters cannot bleed into each other:
  ```bash
  export KC="${HERMES_HOME:-/opt/data}/.kubeconfigs/kubeconfig_<project>_<cluster>_<location>.yaml"
  KUBECONFIG=$KC gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster> --location=<location> --project=<project>
  ```
- **`checks_run` is mandatory on every cluster,** and each entry is an object, never a bare string:
  ```json
  {
    "check": "ccc-missing-fallbacks",
    "command": "kubectl --context prod-usc1 get computeclasses -A -o yaml"
  }
  ```
  `check` is the backticked slug from the §3 heading that defines it — `ccc-missing-fallbacks`, `ccc-no-ondemand-floor`, and so on. `command` is the literal invocation you issued on that cluster for that check. It must name one of `kubectl`, `gcloud`, `gsutil`, `bq`, `helm`, or `curl`; anything under eight characters is rejected.
- **A check the cluster's shape rules out is declared in `checks_not_applicable`** with a specific reason:
  ```json
  {
    "check": "single-zone-nodepool",
    "reason": "Cluster is GKE Autopilot mode; node pool management is fully delegated to GKE."
  }
  ```

### 2. Collect capacity and workload state

Collect the live cluster definitions, GCP reservations, regional capacity metrics, and autoscaler visibility logs:

```bash
# 1. Dump ComputeClasses, Workloads, and StorageClasses
KUBECONFIG=$KC kubectl get computeclasses,deployments,statefulsets,storageclasses -A -o json > /opt/data/scratch/stockout_state_<cluster>.json

# 2. Inspect GCP Reservations (guaranteed capacity anchors)
gcloud compute reservations list --project=<project> --format=json > /opt/data/scratch/reservations_<project>.json

# 3. Inspect GCP Regional Quotas for the cluster's region (e.g. us-central1)
gcloud compute regions describe <region> --project=<project> --format="json(quotas)"

# 4. Check Spot Capacity & Preemption Advice History
gcloud beta compute advice capacity-history --region=<region> --instance-selection-machine-types="g2-standard-4,n4-standard-4,c3-standard-4" --size=1 --types=PREEMPTION,PRICE --format=json

# 5. Autoscaler Visibility Logs (Stage 1 Triage Query)
gcloud logging read 'log_id("container.googleapis.com/cluster-autoscaler-visibility") AND resource.labels.cluster_name="<cluster>" AND (jsonPayload.noDecisionStatus.noScaleUp:* OR jsonPayload.resultInfo.results.errorMsg:*)' --project=<project> --freshness=24h --limit=1000 --format="value(timestamp,resource.labels.cluster_name,jsonPayload.noDecisionStatus.noScaleUp.unhandledPodGroups[0].napFailureReasons[0].messageId)"
```

### 3. Checks

**Standard exclusions — apply to every check below:**

- **S1 — system namespace:** `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `kube-node-lease`, `gmp-system`, `gmp-public`, `gke-gmp-system`, `cnrm-system`, `configconnector-operator-system`, `krmapihosting-system`, `istio-system`, `asm-system`, `anthos-identity-service`, `gatekeeper-system`, `composer-system`, or any namespace matching `gke-*`, `gke-managed-*`, or `config-management-*`.
- **S2 — GKE-managed object:** carries `addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode`.
- **S3 — operator-owned:** non-empty `metadata.ownerReferences`.
- **S4 — explicit opt-out:** carries `kubeagents.x-k8s.io/stockout-audit: exempt`.
- **S5 — not running:** `spec.replicas == 0`, or completed batch Jobs.

#### 3.1 Lack of fallback machine families and dimension diversity (`ccc-missing-fallbacks`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-prioritization.md`
- **Command:** `kubectl --context <ctx> get computeclasses <name> -o yaml`
- **Flag when:** A `ComputeClass` has `priorities[]` pinned to a single machine family or varies fewer than 2 of the 4 core obtainability dimensions across its priority chain: Zone, Family, Capacity Model (Spot vs. On-Demand), and Machine Size (vCPU core count).
- **Do NOT flag:** ComputeClasses that vary 2+ obtainability dimensions (e.g. multi-zone `c3` fallback to `n4` and `n2`, or Spot fallback to On-Demand across zones); standard exclusions.
- **Severity:** `critical`. When GCE encounters a zonal shortage or stockout on that machine family, Cluster Autoscaler has no fallback path and scale-up fails completely.
- **Impact:** "Pinned to a single machine family or narrow configuration: any zonal capacity exhaustion causes scale-up to fail and leaves pods unschedulable."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Add multi-zone distribution and secondary fallback machine families (e.g., fallback from `c3` to `n4` and `n2`) to the ComputeClass manifest in GitOps.

#### 3.2 Spot-only ComputeClass without on-demand safety floor (`ccc-no-ondemand-floor`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-prioritization.md`, `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-gotchas-and-cuds.md`
- **Command:** `kubectl --context <ctx> get computeclasses <name> -o yaml`
- **Flag when:** A ComputeClass `priorities[]` array contains only Spot instances (`spot: true` or `provisioningModel: SPOT`) with no On-Demand priority rule at the end, or a latency-sensitive inference workload is configured Spot-first.
- **Do NOT flag:** ComputeClasses that contain an On-Demand fallback priority at the bottom of `priorities[]`; workloads with explicit non-production/test opt-out.
- **Severity:** `major`.
- **Impact:** "If Spot VM capacity is preempted or exhausted in the region, the workload has no on-demand floor and remains permanently in Pending state."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Append an On-Demand priority rule at the lowest priority in the ComputeClass manifest to act as a guaranteed capacity floor.

#### 3.3 Large VM shape scarcity (>32 vCPU) without multi-family fallbacks (`ccc-large-vm-scarcity`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-prioritization.md`
- **Command:** `kubectl --context <ctx> get deployments,statefulsets,computeclasses -n <ns> <name> -o yaml`
- **Flag when:** A workload or ComputeClass requests very large VM sizes (>32 vCPUs, such as `m1-ultramem-160`, `c3-highcpu-88`, `a2-highgpu-8g`) from thin capacity pools without secondary fallback families or horizontal replica spreading.
- **Do NOT flag:** Workloads requesting standard/horizontal shapes (<=32 vCPUs); stateful monolithic databases that explicitly declare multi-region failover.
- **Severity:** `major`.
- **Impact:** "Very large VM shapes (>32 cores) draw from thin regional capacity pools and are highly prone to sudden stockouts during scale-up."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. If horizontally scalable (verified with `kubectl top pod`), propose smaller replica shapes with horizontal autoscaling; otherwise add fallback machine families in GitOps manifests.

#### 3.4 Excessive priority rules causing autoscaler backoff loops (`ccc-priority-starvation`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-prioritization.md`, `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-debug.md`
- **Command:** `kubectl --context <ctx> get computeclasses <name> -o yaml`
- **Flag when:** A `ComputeClass` contains more than 10 total priority rules (granular `machineType` rules or family entries), exceeding Flex Advisor combinations and triggering Cluster Autoscaler cooldown/backoff reset loops.
- **Do NOT flag:** ComputeClasses using <= 5 broad `machineFamily` level definitions (e.g. `n4`, `c3`, `n2`).
- **Severity:** `critical`.
- **Impact:** "Excessive priority rules (>10) exceed the autoscaler solver cache limit, triggering backoff loops that starve lower priorities."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Auto-compress the ComputeClass: replace granular rules with 3-4 family-level (`machineFamily`) priority rules.

#### 3.5 Mixed disk generations on PV-attached ComputeClasses (`ccc-mixed-disk-generations`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-gotchas-and-cuds.md`, `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-provisioning-methods.md`
- **Command:** `kubectl --context <ctx> get computeclasses,statefulsets -n <ns> <name> -o yaml`
- **Flag when:** A stateful workload using PersistentVolumes references a ComputeClass whose `priorities[]` mixes Gen 2 VMs (`n2`, `n2d`, `c2`) and Gen 4/Hyperdisk VMs (`c4`, `n4`, `c3`), causing PV attachment deadlocks upon failover.
- **Do NOT flag:** Stateless workloads; ComputeClasses whose priorities are purely Gen 2 or purely Gen 4/Hyperdisk-compatible; clusters running GKE 1.35.3+ using the `dynamic-rwo` StorageClass.
- **Severity:** `critical`.
- **Impact:** "Stateful PV workload mixes Gen 2 and Gen 4 machine families, causing volume attachment failures and deadlocks when scaling across nodes."
- **Remediation:** On GKE 1.35.3+, emit `kind: manifest` updating the StorageClass to `dynamic-rwo` (which makes autoscaler disk-topology aware). On older versions or fixed disks, emit `kind: manual` to unify priorities.

#### 3.6 Incompatible machine families for Hyperdisk workloads (`ccc-hyperdisk-incompatible`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-gotchas-and-cuds.md`, `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-provisioning-methods.md`
- **Command:** `kubectl --context <ctx> get storageclasses,computeclasses,deployments -n <ns> -o yaml`
- **Flag when:** A workload using Hyperdisk storage (`hyperdisk-balanced`, `hyperdisk-throughput`, `hyperdisk-extreme`) uses a ComputeClass that falls back to older generation machine families (`c2`, `n2`, `e2`) that do not support Hyperdisk CSI drivers.
- **Do NOT flag:** Workloads using standard Persistent Disk (`pd-standard`, `pd-ssd`); ComputeClasses falling back only to Hyperdisk-capable families (`c3`, `c4`, `n4`, `c3d`).
- **Severity:** `critical`.
- **Impact:** "Autoscaler fallback lands on an older machine family (c2/n2/e2) that does not support Hyperdisk, causing node provisioning or pod volume attachment to fail."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Update ComputeClass fallback priorities to Hyperdisk-compatible families (`c3`, `c4`, `n4`) and remove incompatible older generations.

#### 3.7 Regional quota exhaustion risk across fleet (`quota-exhaustion-risk`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-gotchas-and-cuds.md`
- **Command:** `gcloud compute regions describe <region> --project=<project> --format="json(quotas)"`
- **Flag when:** Total requested GPU/TPU/CPU limits across all clusters in the same GCP project and region reach >=90% of the project's regional quota limit (e.g. demanding 32 L4 GPUs when regional quota is 24).
- **Do NOT flag:** Projects where regional quota limit exceeds total fleet workload demand with >= 25% headroom.
- **Severity:** `critical`.
- **Impact:** "Workload resource requests across fleet exceed regional GCP quota limits; Cluster Autoscaler cannot provision additional nodes even if physical capacity exists."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Adjust workload request caps in GitOps manifests to fit strictly within quota limits, and submit a quota increase recommendation for the GCP project.

#### 3.8 High preemption risk or low obtainability on Spot instances (`spot-scarcity-risk`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-prioritization.md`
- **Command:** `gcloud beta compute advice capacity-history --region=<region> --instance-selection-machine-types="g2-standard-4,n4-standard-4,c3-standard-4" --size=1 --types=PREEMPTION,PRICE --format=json`
- **Flag when:** Workloads or ComputeClasses request Spot VM shapes that have high historical preemption rates (>20%) or low obtainability scores in `compute advice`, without alternative family fallbacks.
- **Do NOT flag:** Spot configurations that have high obtainability scores or comprehensive multi-family fallbacks; non-production environments.
- **Severity:** `major`.
- **Impact:** "Spot machine shapes have high historical preemption rates and severe obtainability constraints, putting workload uptime at extreme risk."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Expand instance selection to include lower-preemption machine types and add secondary on-demand fallback priorities in GitOps.

#### 3.9 Single-zone node pools on Standard clusters (`single-zone-nodepool`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-provisioning-methods.md`
- **Command:** `gcloud container node-pools list --cluster=<cluster> --location=<location> --format=json`
- **Flag when:** A Standard mode GKE cluster has autoscaling node pools restricted to a single zone with no Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP) or regional multi-zone node pools configured, or node pools near `autoscaling.maxNodeCount` ceilings.
- **Do NOT flag:** Autopilot clusters (fully managed multi-zone); regional clusters with multi-zone node pools.
- **Severity:** `major`.
- **Impact:** "Node pool is locked to a single zone: any zonal stockout in that zone halts all cluster auto-scaling."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Propose enabling multi-zone node pools or configuring Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP) in Terraform/Kustomize declarations.

#### 3.10 Reservation bypass, unreachable zones, or unallocated capacity mismatch (`reservation-mismatch-risk`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-gotchas-and-cuds.md`, `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-debug.md`
- **Command:** `gcloud compute reservations list --project=<project> --format=json`
- **Flag when:** (a) A ComputeClass sets `reservations.affinity: AnyBestEffort/Automatic`, which silently bypasses ComputeClass priority chains and falls back to On-Demand at GCE layer; (b) A ComputeClass targets a specific reservation that does not exist or sits in an unreachable zone; or (c) Substantial reservation capacity is unallocated (`inUseCount << count`) while production workloads in the same region run unreserved. (Note: CUDs are financial commitments, not physical capacity reservations).
- **Do NOT flag:** ComputeClasses with valid targeted reservation bindings; non-production workloads.
- **Severity:** `critical` for broken/bypassed bindings, `major` for unallocated capacity mismatches.
- **Impact:** "ComputeClass fallback priorities are rendered inert by Automatic reservation affinity, or expensive guaranteed reservation capacity sits idle during stockouts."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Target specific reservation names in GitOps manifests or update ComputeClass location to align with active reservations.

#### 3.11 Autoscaler out-of-resources leading indicators (`autoscaler-out-of-resources`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-debug.md`
- **Command:** `gcloud logging read 'log_id("container.googleapis.com/cluster-autoscaler-visibility") AND resource.labels.cluster_name="<cluster>" AND (jsonPayload.noDecisionStatus.noScaleUp:* OR jsonPayload.resultInfo.results.errorMsg:*)' --project=<project> --freshness=24h --limit=1000 --format="value(timestamp,resource.labels.cluster_name,jsonPayload.noDecisionStatus.noScaleUp.unhandledPodGroups[0].napFailureReasons[0].messageId)"`
- **Flag when:** Cluster autoscaler visibility logs emit `scale.up.error.out.of.resources`, `scale.up.error.quota.exceeded`, or `scale.up.error.ip.space.exhausted` within the past 24 hours, indicating that scale-up attempts failed before fallback recovery.
- **Do NOT flag:** Clusters with clean autoscaler visibility logs over 24h.
- **Severity:** `critical`.
- **Impact:** "Autoscaler has actively failed scale-up attempts due to physical cloud stockouts, quota exhaustion, or pod subnet IP exhaustion."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Add secondary fallback families/zones to affected ComputeClasses, expand pod subnet CIDR if IP-exhausted, or request regional quota increase.

#### 3.12 Dangling, unlabelled, or invalid ComputeClass configurations (`dangling-compute-class`)

- **Reference:** `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-crd-fields.md`, `skills/gke-compute-classes/references/compute-class-debug.md`
- **Command:** `kubectl --context <ctx> get computeclasses,deployments,statefulsets -A -o yaml`
- **Flag when:** (a) A workload's `nodeSelector: cloud.google.com/compute-class` or namespace `cloud.google.com/default-compute-class` references a ComputeClass that does not exist; (b) A ComputeClass `status.conditions` reports invalid configuration; (c) `nodePoolAutoCreation.enabled` is false and referenced node pools lack `cloud.google.com/compute-class` label/taints; or (d) A GPU workload references a ComputeClass without declaring `nvidia.com/gpu` tolerations.
- **Do NOT flag:** Workloads referencing valid, reconciled ComputeClasses with matching node pool labels and tolerations.
- **Severity:** `critical`.
- **Impact:** "Workload cannot be scheduled due to dangling class references, invalid CRD configuration, or missing node tolerations, causing permanent Pending state."
- **Remediation:** `kind: manifest`. Correct the ComputeClass name in GitOps, fix invalid CRD fields, or add required GPU tolerations to workload templates.

### 4. Generate remediation artifacts

- Locate the existing declaration in the GitOps clone (`grep -rl "name: <object>" --include='*.yaml' <workspace>`).
- **Remediation Feasibility Gate**: Before proposing a new machine family or Spot tier, verify that:
  1. The target GCP zone actually offers the machine type (`gcloud compute machine-types list --zones=<zone>`).
  2. The project quota for that family (`N4_CPUS`, `C4_CPUS`, `PREEMPTIBLE_CPUS`, GPU types) is greater than 0.
- Edit the manifest directly in `<workspace>`, adding the necessary fallback machine families, zones, or quota adjustments.
- **Mandatory Remediation Comments**: For every modified line in YAML, append an inline `# Remediation: <reason>` comment.
- Set `remediation.path` to the repo-relative file path, with `kind: manifest`.
- Reviewers may comment `/remediate <finding-id>` or `/remediate all` on the ledger issue to promote findings into PRs.

### 5. Emit findings.json

Write the schema exactly as the helper validates it to the `findings_path` returned in Step 0: `audit` set to `stockout-prevention`; `scope.clusters` non-empty, each entry carrying the mandatory `checks_run` list of `{check, command}` objects for the §3 checks that actually ran there; and for each finding, `check`, `severity`, `title`, `cluster`, `namespace`, `object`, `evidence.command`, `evidence.excerpt`, `impact`, `recommendation`, and `remediation`.

### 6. Close the audit run

```bash
./skills/fleet-audit/scripts/audit_report.py finish --audit stockout-prevention \
  --findings-file /opt/data/scratch/findings_stockout-prevention.json
```

One JSON line comes back, carrying `status`, `issue_url`, `new`, `resolved`, `prs_opened`, `prs_closed`, `partial`, `coverage_gaps`, and `silent_ok`. Exit 2 means the validator rejected the document and nothing was published — fix the document, do not retry blind. Exit 1 is fatal. Exit 0 means it published.

`partial` is `true` when the run could not read the whole fleet: any cluster in `scope.skipped`, or any cluster kept in scope with a `limitations` note. `coverage_gaps` names each one in a sentence. The harness then refuses to draw conclusions from silence, because a workload or ComputeClass you never queried is not one that got resolved: `resolved` comes back `0` and no resolved-delta is posted, no remediation PR is retired as stale, and the ledger issue stays open even at zero findings — `status` is still `CLEAN`, but the issue survives with a comment naming what went unread. A check declared in `checks_not_applicable` is not a gap and does not raise the flag; it left the denominator. Nothing else raises it — it is `true` if and only if `coverage_gaps` is non-empty. A fleet big enough that the description had to drop findings is not a coverage gap: those workloads were queried, the title counts them, and the body says which ones it left out.

**`silent_ok` decides silence. Do not re-derive it.** `finish` returns `silent_ok: true` only when this run moved nothing an operator needs to hear about: nothing new, nothing resolved, no coverage gap, no remediation PR opened or closed. Read the flag rather than reassembling that from `status`, `new`, `resolved`, and `partial` yourself — that arithmetic is where a run talks itself into silence it has not earned. Two rules, and they are the whole rule:

- On a **scheduled** run, `silent_ok: true` → your entire final response is exactly `[SILENT]`. Otherwise report, and every report carries `issue_url` in full.
- **An on-demand run is never silent.** If a person dispatched this job — from a kanban card or straight from chat — someone is waiting on the answer, and `[SILENT]` throws it away. Report the outcome and the ledger URL whatever `silent_ok` says.

What to report in each case:

- `silent_ok: true` — `[SILENT]` on a scheduled run, nothing else and no preamble. On `CLEAN` the ledger issue closed as completed and every open remediation PR for this stream closed with it; on `UPDATED` the ledger was rewritten but nothing moved. Dispatched on demand, say which in one line and give the issue URL.
- `status: "CLEAN"` with `resolved: > 0` — every capacity gap this ledger tracked has been closed. Report the issue URL and the count.
- `status: "CLEAN"` with `partial: true` — nothing reproduced, but the ledger and its PRs stayed open because the coverage was incomplete. One line, the clean result plus the `coverage_gaps`, then stop.
- Any other outcome — reply with **one line**: counts by severity, new vs. resolved, skipped-cluster count if any, remediation PRs opened or closed, and the `issue_url`.

## Red Lines

- **Read-only against every cluster.** No `apply`, `patch`, `edit`, `delete`, `scale`, `drain`, `cordon`, or eviction.
- **No hand-written issue or PR bodies, and no direct git/gh calls.** `audit_report.py` owns the ledger issue, the remediation branches, the commits, and every body it renders.
- **No credentials in evidence.** A Secret's `data:` block, a token, or a private key never enters an excerpt; re-read with a projection that omits it.
- **A finding you cannot reproduce is dropped, not softened.** `evidence.command` is the literal command you executed; if the confirm read fails or the condition has cleared, the finding does not ship.
- **No fabricated numbers.** Resource quantities and machine families are either read off the live object or left to a human.
- **Stable ids or the delta lies.** An unstable id — one that varies between runs because the `object` it is derived from moved — turns one persistent problem into an infinite stream of "new" findings.
