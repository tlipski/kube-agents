"""A reply to an event-triage report, from delivery to the agent's turn (#802).

Three components own one behaviour between them and none of them can see the
other two:

1. ``deploy/docker/patches/kanban_notifier.store_incident_report`` posts the row
   when the notifier delivers a completed triage card into a chat thread.
2. ``session_kv_server``'s ``/v1/incidents`` routes store it and hand it back by
   ``(chat_id, thread_id)``.
3. The ``incident_context`` gateway plugin looks it up on every inbound message
   and prepends what it finds to the user's words.

Each of the three has its own unit tests and all three passed on ``main`` while
the chain was broken: #738 removed the only writer of the table and the reader
went on failing open, exactly as it is supposed to when the server is down. The
symptom was a user replying "apply Option A" in a thread and reaching an agent
that had never heard of Option A. Nothing short of driving the three together
can see that, which is what this module does — real notifier, real FastAPI app,
real SQLite file, real plugin, with the loopback socket replaced by a TestClient
because the two ends are in different processes in production and in one here.

## What's wrong

The `checkout` deployment on `prod-us-central1` cannot schedule: 0/3 replicas are Running.

## Why

- Each replica requests 8Gi of memory and every node in `default-pool` reports
  `Allocatable: memory: 3910Mi`, so the scheduler has nowhere to place them.

## What to do

- **Option A (Right-size the request):** lower `resources.requests.memory` to 2Gi in
  `apps/checkout/deployment.yaml`.
- **Option B (Add a larger node pool):** add an `e2-standard-8` pool and a nodeSelector.
- ✅ **Recommended: Option A** — no new capacity to pay for, drain, or delete later.
- **To authorize:** reply **'apply'** to open a GitOps Pull Request with the recommended fix, \
or name one directly with **'apply Option A'** / **'apply Option B'**.
