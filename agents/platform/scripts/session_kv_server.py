    KEPT AS A BACKSTOP, no longer load-bearing. The disagreement it was written
    for is fixed at its source in #786: the operator now pins `API_SERVER_KEY`
    in the managed `.env` (`renderManagedEnv` in
    `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go`), which
    `load_hermes_dotenv` applies LAST with `override=True` — after the PVC file
    — so `os.environ["API_SERVER_KEY"]` and this function now return the same
    value on an operator-managed pod, and the fallback below is what runs.

    What went wrong, because the shape recurs. The operator sets that name to
    the non-secret loopback sentinel `cluster-internal-trusted`, on the premise
    that the listener is loopback-only and the credential-proxy sidecar
    authenticates outside callers against `API_SERVER_EXTERNAL_KEY`. Hermes did
    not honour that premise from this side: `$HERMES_HOME/.env` is loaded over
    the process environment, deliberately, so that a key rotation in that file
    is not shadowed by a stale export — and Hermes' Docker stage2 hook writes a
    freshly generated strong key into that file whenever it does not already
    carry one. The sentinel was therefore overridden on every boot by a value
    nothing else in the system had ever seen, and every caller that trusted the
    environment got 401.

    Measured on kage-management 2026-08-18: seven consecutive
    `github-repo-watcher` relay turns rejected in one pod's first two hours,
    each degrading to an unrelayed raw report that the scheduler still recorded
    as delivered.

    An earlier note here said that writing the sentinel into `.env` to force
    agreement was tried and made the API server decline to bind. That was
    confounded — the pod had lost its credential-proxy sidecar in the same
    window. Hermes' actual constraint is `has_usable_secret(min_length=16)` in
    `gateway/platforms/api_server.py`'s startup guard, and the 24-character
    sentinel clears it. The managed `.env` pin does not touch that file at all
    in any case; it wins by being applied after it.

    The order below MIRRORS `hermes_cli/env_loader.py`, and reproducing it is
    the point — a resolver that guesses differently from the server it is
    guessing about is worse than no resolver, because it fails while looking
    right. Managed `.env` beats PVC `.env` beats the process environment,
    because that is the order `load_hermes_dotenv` applies them in, each with
    `override=True`. Reading the PVC file first — this function's original
    shape, correct before the pin — would now return stage2's generated key on
    exactly the pods the pin has already fixed.

    Read per call rather than cached at import: `.env` is rewritten a few
    seconds *after* this process starts, so an import-time read would return the
    last boot's key on a deployment that still has the disagreement.

    `cluster` is recorded because this server is shared: one session KV
    database backs every cluster profile in the pod, which is the same reason
    the daily ceiling is fleet-wide. Without it the recap cannot tell two
    same-named workloads in two clusters apart, and would merge `prod/api` on
    one cluster with `prod/api` on another into a single line.

    Best-effort on purpose. This runs on the path that announces a live
    incident, and a recap that misses a row is a smaller failure than an alert
    that never reaches chat because the bookkeeping raised.

    Returns the row id so the delivery attempt can correct `notified` when the
    post fails, or None when the write itself did not land. `notified=True`
    here is an *intent* — the row is written before anything is sent, because
    the send happens in a background task and a row written afterwards would be
    lost entirely if the process died mid-flight. `mark_delivery_failed` is what
    turns that intent back into an observation.

    `object_uid` is the involved object's UID, stored because `workload` cannot
    substitute for it: `clean_workload_name` strips the replica suffix, so every
    pod of one Deployment shares a `workload`. The recap counts alerts the daily
    ceiling withheld, and a ceiling refusal makes the watcher forget its dedup
    entry — so the same incident writes a row per sighting while N replicas write
    rows that look alike. Only the UID separates those two cases, and it is the
    watcher's own dedup key.

    `message` is truncated to `LEDGER_MESSAGE_MAX_CHARS` on the way in rather
    than on the way out. The reader's 120-character cut is a display choice and
    leaves the row itself unbounded, and the row is what the shared session PVC
    has to hold once a storm is writing one per sighting.

# channel and a gateway that could not connect, so every scheduled governance
# report from 2026-08-25 to 2026-09-01 was composed by the Chat Agent, posted
# nowhere, and lost. Google Chat first means a dual-platform install *gains* a
# platform rather than having its messages moved to one; the same order, for the
# same reason, is what open PR #996 gives the Cluster Agent reconcile summary.
#

# nothing puts it in the list whatever the order says.

# true (platformagent_manifests.go, the GoogleChat/Slack blocks in
# buildPodTemplateSpec and renderManagedEnv), so it answers the question rather
# than approximating it.
#
# SLACK_BOT_TOKEN is kept, and is inert on a deployed pod: a token is a

    only a lower-precedence source knows about. That short circuit is the shape
    of the bug this replaces: one `if` matched, the function returned, and the
    other platform was never considered.

    1. The managed scope, `/etc/hermes/config.yaml`. On an operator-managed pod
       this settles it outright: `renderConfigYAML` writes both
       `platforms.<p>.enabled` keys as explicit booleans on every reconcile, so
       the CR's answer is on disk in the container and there is nothing to
       infer. Reading it is what #1094 means by "stop guessing the platform".
    2. CONFIG_PATH — `/opt/data/config.yaml`, the front door's own writable
       file rather than a named profile's. Authoritative on
       an install that has no operator — a `docker run` off the image, a profile
       configured by hand — and normally silent on a managed pod: Hermes
       overlays the managed scope per leaf inside its own config loader rather
       than merging it onto this file (docker-entrypoint.sh, "The pins do NOT
       come through this file"), so the `platforms` subtree here carries no
       `enabled` key at all. #855 established that; it is read second rather
       than dropped because it is the truth on the installs that do write it.
    3. The environment signals above, for an install neither file describes.

    Never returns an empty list — an install that resolves to nothing gets
    DEFAULT_CHAT_PLATFORM.

    This is the third copy of this question in the tree, and the copies should
    converge rather than a fourth being added: `platform_mcp_server
    .get_enabled_platforms` is still keyed on the absent SLACK_BOT_TOKEN (#735
    is open against it), and `chat_platforms.enabled_chat_platforms` answers it
    for the Cluster Agent reconcile summary (#989).

    Converging on `chat_platforms` is now safe on the sources as well as on the
    ORDER and the per-platform resolution. This paragraph used to warn that it
    was not: #996 read `CONFIG_PATH` then the environment, so re-pointing at it
    would have dropped the managed scope, and on a pod whose CR sets
    `slack.enabled: false` while a stale `SLACK_RELAY_URL` lingers in the
    container environment that is not a refactor but a re-enabled leg an
    operator turned off. #996 carried `_platforms_enabled_in(MANAGED_CONFIG_PATH)`
    across before merging, as that warning asked. The two functions now agree on
    all three sources and their precedence, and both pin the stale-relay-URL case
    (`test_managed_false_beats_a_stale_relay_url` there, `TestEnabledChatPlatforms`
    here). What remains between them is which callers they serve, not what they

    """Save thread configurations in session_metadata SQLite table.

    These three fields — `platform`, `chat_id`, `thread_id` — are the address
    the event-triage card's report is delivered to.
    `deploy/docker/patches/kanban_event_routing.py` reads the row back by
    session id when the front door files that card, and substitutes them for the
    `api_server` origin the REST gateway would otherwise stamp on the
    subscription. Writing this row is therefore ordered before the agent turn is
    started, not merely before the reply arrives.

    `platform` is what this function adds to the row, and the substitution needs
    it: a thread belongs to exactly one chat platform, and `hermes send` refuses
    a Google Chat thread addressed as Slack rather than degrading it to the home
    channel. A row without it carries `k8s-watcher` from `POST /sessions`, which
    the patch treats as non-chat and declines to substitute — so a session that
    never reached this function keeps today's behaviour instead of being
    re-addressed to a guess.

    The same call also records the thread under `platform_threads`, keyed by
    platform. Those three fields hold ONE address because the card has one
    destination, but a fanned-out cron report has a thread per platform, and
    keeping only the winner's is what made a leg that failed once stay unthreaded
    for the rest of the day: the next report found the row naming another
    platform, posted a fresh top-level message, and did it again on every run.
    `platform_threads` is additive and never overwritten by another platform, so
    each leg keeps its own thread whatever the top-level fields say.

def _triage_task_body(payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """The kanban card body the front door files for the failing cluster's agent.

    Written to be copied verbatim rather than summarised, because a paraphrase
    is how the front door turned one instruction into three on 2026-08-17.

    The delivery is `kanban_complete` and nothing else. The card carries a
    subscription pointing at the chat thread the alert was posted in — see
    `deploy/docker/patches/kanban_event_routing.py`, which resolves that thread
    from the routing this module records — so the notifier posts the `result`
    when the card turns terminal. That is why this body asks for the whole
    report in `result` rather than a summary of it: `result` is the message the
    human reads.

    The report template below is a second instruction channel alongside the
    persona, and says "formatted exactly like this" — so it wins any
    disagreement with the Platform Agent's SOUL.md §7 (Incident Triage
    Communication Policy), which governs the same output. Keep the two in step:
    §7 permits exactly the three ``##`` sections this template uses, and a
    fourth labelled block added here silently overrides the policy rather than
    extending it. The template states that shape itself rather than citing the
    section, because the reader is a Cluster Agent, whose persona has no §7 —
    the delegation to that persona is what makes the citation unresolvable for
    the agent being asked to obey it.

    The report ends by inviting the reader to reply ``apply``, and something
    honours it. The agent that acts on such a reply reads the report back from
    the ``incidents`` table through the ``incident_context`` plugin, and the row
    that lookup needs is written by the same delivery that posted the report:
    ``kanban_notifier.store_incident_report`` keys it to the chat thread once
    the notifier has sent it. That was not true between #738 — which replaced
    the egress call in ``platform_mcp_server.send_notification``, the table's
    only writer, with ``kanban_complete`` — and #802, which restored the write
    on the new path. In that window the invitation was withheld here, because a
    reply to it reached the front door as the bare word ``apply`` with no
    report, no options and no cluster. So the bullet is load-bearing on that
    write: if the row stops being written, take the bullet out again rather
    than leaving a promise the system cannot keep.

    A report with one option is not lettered. "Option A" standing alone asks
    the reader to pick from a list of one, so that shape labels the bullet
    **Proposed fix** and stops the call to action at ``apply``. What the letter
    was also doing is evidence: ``kanban_notifier.actionable_report`` decided
    which completions earn an ``incidents`` row by looking for ``Option <A-Z>``
    under ``What to do``, and an unlettered report would have earned none — the
    bare-``apply`` failure below, reintroduced with nothing red. It now takes
    the ``To authorize:`` bullet as that evidence, which is the one line both
    shapes carry. So the label in this template and the pattern in that gate are
    one decision in two files: change the words here and the gate stops
    recognising the report. A third file reads it too —
    bench/tasks/autoops-warning-event-triage/task.yaml's delivery objective
    keys on the same literals — so a reword here has three readers to
    reconcile, not one. ``test_triage_reply_roundtrip.py`` holds this template
    against the gate; bench/tests/test_triage_delivery_contract.py holds it
    against both the gate and that eval case.

    §7 rule 3 — "no offer to help further" — does not reach the bullet. Rule 3
    is about closing chatter, the "let me know if you need anything else" that
    ends a message with nothing in it; rule 1 requires the report to say what
    the agent wants done. The report asks the reader for exactly one decision,
    and the ``To authorize:`` bullet is how that decision is expressed. It is
    the ask, not an offer alongside it.

    The report template below is STANDARD markdown, and must stay that way.
    Every chat platform's adapter translates the agent's markdown on the way
    out; on Slack that is ``SlackAdapter.format_message``, which rewrites
    ``**bold**`` to ``*bold*`` and ``[label](url)`` to ``<url|label>``. Writing
    the template in the destination's own syntax does not skip that pass, it
    feeds it: a pre-authored ``*Issue:*`` matches format_message's single-
    asterisk ITALIC rule and every heading in the delivered report came out
    italic instead of bold. Authoring in markdown also lets the Block Kit
    renderer (``platforms.slack.extra.rich_blocks`` in agents/chat/config.yaml)
    see the structure and emit real header, list and table blocks.

# budget. What it does not have is a voice: `deliver` on a named profile

# process that actually owns the conversation with the user — never learns the
# finding happened.
#
# This relay closes that gap by separating who reasons (the specialist) from
# who speaks (the Chat Agent). The specialist finishes its work and hands the
# finished report here; the Chat Agent is given one turn to present it, and the
# report plus the Chat Agent's framing land in the thread the user replies into.
#
# It deliberately does NOT reuse /sessions/{id}/inject. That route is an
# incident path: it classifies severity, spends `alert_quota`, and hands the
# agent the triage template. A scheduled report is neither an incident nor a
# thing that should be silently dropped because a node storm spent the day's
# Warning budget.

    wrong; the caller turns that into a non-2xx and the string ends up in the
    job's `last_delivery_error` — see :func:`submit_cron_report`.

    `undelivered` names the enabled platforms this report did not reach while
    another one did. The send fans out — every platform
    :func:`enabled_chat_platforms` resolves gets the report, because a
    dual-platform install has two audiences and delivering to one of them is
    how #1094 lost seven days of governance output to a Slack leg that had no
    home channel and no connection. A partial failure is a 200: the report is
    in a channel and a re-run would post it twice to the platform that already
    has it. It is not silent either — the caller puts this list in the response
    body, from where the relay adapter writes it to `last_delivery_error`.

    `degraded` is the half that a boolean-or-nothing return used to swallow. The
    Chat Agent's turn can fail while the send still succeeds, and posting the raw
    report is the right call there — a scheduled finding that reached a real
    problem should not be lost because the front door was busy. But "delivered"
    and "delivered, unrelayed" are not the same outcome, and reporting them
    identically is how seven consecutive `github-repo-watcher` relay failures sat
    unnoticed on kage-management while every run recorded a clean delivery
    (2026-08-18; see :func:`_gateway_api_token` for the cause). So the
    degradation is now said twice: once in the channel, via
    :func:`_unrelayed_notice`, and once in this return value, which the caller
    puts in the response body.

    Ordering is deliberate. The turn runs before the send so that what reaches
    chat is the Chat Agent's message rather than a placeholder it later talks
    around; the routing registration and the incident store happen after the
    send because both need the thread the send resolves. If the turn fails the
    report is posted unrelayed — a scheduled finding that reached a real problem
    should not be lost because the front door was busy.

    typed into the main compose box, or any top-level Slack channel message —
    where the by-thread lookup necessarily misses but the reports are sitting
    in the channel above, unreachable. Naming them is enough for the agent to
    ask which one instead of answering about the wrong one.

    It returns no report text, deliberately. No writer of this table stores
    something safe to preview: the relay persists its own composed output, the
    notifier persists a specialist's report quoting cluster objects, and either
    would carry model-written or third-party text into every ordinary message in
    the space. `job_id`, `title` and `profile` are fields this server wrote
    itself.

    `incidents` is the source of truth for "a report was posted here";
    `session_metadata` only supplies the label. A row written by the
    `send_notification` path or by the kanban notifier's triage delivery has no
    relay session and so no job to name -- `incident_context._index_text`
    renders it unlabelled -- and still belongs in the index.
