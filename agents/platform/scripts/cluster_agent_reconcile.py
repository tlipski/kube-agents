# cluster_agent_reconcile.py - Reconcile Cluster Agent profiles with the live GKE fleet.
#
# Cluster Agents are Hermes profiles on the data PVC ($HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>), one per
# managed GKE cluster, each stamped with a `cluster_identity` block in its config.yaml.
#
# Policy: **every cluster in the project gets a Cluster Agent profile**, including the
# management cluster where kube-agents itself runs. Only names listed in RECONCILE_EXCLUDE
# are left unmanaged. Per run this deterministic engine:
#   • CREATE — scaffolds a profile for every project cluster that doesn't have one yet;
#   • PRUNE  — deletes a profile whose cluster is *definitively* gone (a NotFound/404 from
#     `gcloud container clusters describe`), or whose cluster was added to RECONCILE_EXCLUDE
#     after the fact. Any other error path — auth, network, timeout, quota, an unreadable
#     identity — is treated as "unknown" and the profile is left untouched: we never delete
#     on ambiguity.
#
# The management cluster used to be excluded, identified via the GKE metadata server. It is
# not any more, because an event on that cluster now needs an agent scoped to it like every
# other cluster's does: the triage session runs on the Planning Agent, whose one instruction is
# to delegate it to the profile scoped to the cluster that raised the event
# (session_kv_server.trigger_agent_troubleshooter), so a cluster without a profile is a
# cluster whose alerts have nobody to answer them. Two consequences worth knowing:
#   • the event watcher must not then watch that cluster twice, once through --in-cluster and
#     once through the new profile — buildWatchSet in cmd/k8s-event-watcher/main.go drops the
#     duplicate;
#   • the management cluster's Cluster Agent can read the harness's own namespace with the pod's
#     GSA — not the KSA, since create_profile pins a get-credentials kubeconfig — so how far that
#     reaches is the GSA's permission set: no Secrets on the default read-only roles, and Secrets
#     included on any `custom` set that names an admin role. RECONCILE_EXCLUDE is the opt-out,
#     and the security reference is the canonical statement.
#
# It runs as a `no_agent` cron job on the profile the gateway actually ticks (the `default`/chat
# profile — see docs/designs/fleet-handover-retirement.md §4). Scripts and the profiles PVC are
# shared pod-wide, so it operates on every profile regardless of which profile ticks it. It is
# resilient (always exit 0 on the cron path) and posts a summary to every configured chat
# platform only when it created or pruned. `--require-create-pass` opts out of that for a caller
# that has to know whether the roster is actually reconciled; the bootstrap scan gate is the only
# one.
