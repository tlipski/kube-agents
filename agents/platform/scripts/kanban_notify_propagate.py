# kanban_notify_propagate.py - Copy a parent kanban card's chat subscription onto
# a child card, so the child's completion pings the user's chat thread too.
#
# NOTE: the agent image now does this automatically at kanban_create time (the
# kanban_auto_subscribe patch in deploy/docker/patches/); this script remains a
# manual/back-fill tool, and its INSERT OR IGNORE makes the double-write harmless.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# The gateway kanban notifier delivers thread updates by iterating rows in the
# `kanban_notify_subs` table: a card with no subscription row is invisible to it
# (no line posted, no agent woken). Subscriptions are written by
# `_maybe_auto_subscribe` at `kanban_create` time, which reads the originating
# chat identity (`HERMES_SESSION_CHAT_ID` / `_THREAD_ID` / `_PLATFORM`) from the
# session context. Those context vars are set ONLY on inbound user messages.
#
# A specialist agent that is running as a dispatcher-spawned kanban worker has no
# such session context, so the child cards it creates to stage its work are NOT
# auto-subscribed — and their completions never reach the user. This helper closes
# that gap: it copies the parent card's subscription row(s) onto a freshly created
# child, so each staged sub-step's completion posts its own line into the same
# chat thread the original request came from.
#
# Usage (run by the specialist right after creating a child card):
#   python3 /opt/data/scripts/kanban_notify_propagate.py --to <child_id> [--from <parent_id>]
#
# `--from` defaults to $HERMES_KANBAN_TASK (the worker's current card). The board
# DB is read from $HERMES_KANBAN_DB (pinned into every worker by the dispatcher).
#
# Idempotent (INSERT OR IGNORE on the subscription primary key) and fail-soft: any
# operational problem is logged to stderr and exits 0 so it can never break the
# specialist's flow. It couples only to the stable `kanban_notify_subs` columns,
# plus a soft read of `tasks` to confirm the child card is real before writing a
# subscription row that nothing would ever clean up (see `propagate`).

# Hermes surfaces as a clear error (and a failing unit test) rather than

    hard way (a cursor of 0 on an already-active task produced a boot-time
    burst of 100+ messages, Hermes issue #29905) and both upstream seeding
    paths now snap to the head. This script is more exposed to it than either,
    not less: back-filling a subscription onto a card that has already run is
    exactly what it is for, and on a card that already completed, a cursor of 0
    posts a "done" line for work nobody just asked about.

    Soft-coupled the same way as the `tasks` check in `propagate`: a board
    without `task_events` falls back to 0 rather than losing the propagation
    altogether, since a lost propagation costs the user every progress update
    for that sub-step.
