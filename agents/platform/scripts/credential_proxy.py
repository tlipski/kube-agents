# Who is calling
#
# For as long as the broker ran as a sidecar, nothing on this path
# authenticated anything.  What kept the credentials safe was geometry: Envoy
# bound 127.0.0.1, so only the Pod could reach it, and the socket behind Envoy
# was 0600 in an emptyDir that only this container mounted.  Both of those
# properties are properties of *sharing a network namespace*, and both
# evaporate the moment the broker becomes its own Pod.  So a split needs an
# answer to "who is calling", and this is it.
#
# The answer is a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token, projected into the caller
# with a dedicated audience, presented as a bearer token, and verified here
# with a TokenReview against the API server.  Three reasons for that shape
# rather than mTLS or a Unix socket per caller:
#
#   * It needs no PKI.  This repository has no cert-manager for workloads, no
#     service mesh and no SPIFFE; mTLS would mean standing all of that up, or
#     minting certificates in the operator, before a single request could be
#     authenticated.  The projected token already exists in the cluster.
#   * It needs no Envoy filter.  The Envoy config is baked into the image and
#     loaded by absolute path, so an ext_authz or JWT filter is an image
#     rebuild that cannot vary per agent.  A bearer header rides through the
#     router filter untouched and is checked here, in code the operator can
#     configure with an environment variable.
#   * It forecloses nothing.  mTLS is a transport underneath this, not a
#     replacement for it: adding a client certificate later leaves the request
#     shape, the handler and this verifier intact, and gives ``Principal`` a
#     second, stronger source for the same field.  gRPC carries bearer
#     credentials in exactly the same ``authorization`` metadata key, so a
#     later move to gRPC ports the identity model verbatim.  What it does
#     foreclose is a Unix socket per caller — but a Unix socket needs a shared
#     filesystem, which is the one thing splitting the Pods takes away.
#
# What it is honestly *not*: encryption.  The token crosses the cluster
# network in cleartext, exactly as the github-token-minter call already does
# (see github_token_refresh.py).  Anyone who can observe pod-to-pod traffic in
# the namespace can replay it until it expires.  mTLS closes that, and the
# NetworkPolicy work in the next task narrows who can open the connection at
# all.  Neither is done here.

    """Who the broker believes is on the other end of a request.

    ``workload`` is what the transport can prove today: the Kubernetes identity
    of the ServiceAccount whose projected token authenticated the connection.

    Read that literally — it is **per-ServiceAccount**, and weaker than
    per-Pod. The agent Pod and the broker Pod run as the same ServiceAccount,
    because the Workload Identity IAM binding names it and giving the agent one
    of its own would take the broker's cloud credentials with it. So this field
    excludes every other workload in the cluster and nothing finer: it cannot
    distinguish the agent Pod from the broker Pod, let alone one session inside
    the agent Pod from another. It answers "which ServiceAccount", not "which
    Pod" and not "on whose behalf".

    ``caller`` is where a per-caller identity would go, and it is deliberately
    a field on the object rather than a second parameter threaded through the
    handler. When that model is settled, the agent obtains a capability token
    scoped to one session — *attenuating*, so it can never name more authority
    than the workload token it was exchanged for — and sends it alongside the
    workload token. This class grows one more verification step that populates
    ``caller`` from it, ``authenticate`` keeps its signature, and the policy
    layer downstream reads ``principal.caller`` where it reads
    ``principal.workload`` today. Nothing about the request shape, the
    handler, or the operator's rendering has to change again.
    ``caller`` stays None until then. What must hold in the meantime is that
    neither field is ever derived from the request body — from ``argv``, from
    ``cwd``, from anything a model produced. Both come from a token the API
    server verified.

    """The keyed shorthands buried inside a single-dash cluster, re-dashed.

    pflag accepts a boolean shorthand and a value-taking one in the same token:
    `gh api -iX PUT` is `--include --method PUT`, because `parseSingleShortArg`
    consumes `-i`, sets the remainder as the shorts still to read, and re-enters
    the loop. The splitter above only ever takes the *first* shorthand off, so
    that argv reaches the rules as `-i X ...` -- with the `-X` that
    `github.api-mutation` matches on reduced to a bare letter. The merge went
    through. `gh auth status -at` is the same shape against
    `github.token-disclosure`, and that one returns the installation token to
    the agent.

    So each subsequent letter that a rule keys on is re-emitted with its dash,
    followed by whatever is left of the token, which is where pflag would take
    that shorthand's value from.

    The walk stops at the first non-letter, because a cluster of shorthands is
    letters by definition and everything from a non-letter on is somebody's
    value: without that, `-nkube-system` would emit a `-t` off `system` and a
    `gh auth status` somewhere in the same command would be refused for it.

    Two bounds, because the argv is chosen by the sandbox and the sidecar holds
    every agent's credentials. A keyed flag is emitted **once**, since the rules
    ask whether it is present and a millionth `-a` answers nothing a first one
    did not. And a remainder is emitted **once at most**, at the first
    value-taking shorthand, which is also where pflag stops reading the cluster.
    Emitting a fresh copy of the suffix per keyed letter made this quadratic:
    `["gh", "-" + "a" * 1000000]` fits inside `max_request_bytes`, reaches here
    because `gh` is an allowed executable, and exhausted the container's 2Gi on
    a single request. This walk allocates one slice, at the break.

    Two normalisations, both of which the rules would otherwise get wrong in

    Free-text flag values are dropped, so prose the agent wrote is not searched
    for command tokens. Without this the denylist refuses the agent's own pull
    requests -- a false positive that takes the product down rather than an
    attacker.

    Attached shorthand values are split apart. gh, kubectl and gcloud are all
    Cobra/pflag, which accepts a shorthand's value with no separator, so
    `gh api -XPUT repos/o/r/pulls/1/merge` is `-X PUT` and performs the merge
    that `github.api-mutation` exists to refuse -- while matching neither
    branch of it, because there is no whitespace or `=` after `-X`. Splitting
    `-XPUT` into `-X PUT` closes that without the rule having to enumerate
    spellings. `-fmerge_method=squash` becomes `-f merge_method=squash` for the
    same reason.

    Splitting the first shorthand off is deliberately unconditional rather than
    gated on a table of value-taking shorthands: emitting `-A w` for the
    boolean cluster `-Aw` costs nothing, since no rule keys on a bare letter,
    and a table would be one more thing to keep in step with four upstream
    CLIs.

    That reasoning holds for a cluster of booleans and fails for a cluster

    #   --exec/-x   `git rebase -x <cmd> HEAD~1` runs <cmd> once per commit.
    #               `rebase` *is* in GIT_MUTATING_SUBCOMMANDS, so it needs a
    #               lease — which is not a barrier, since the agent creates its
    #               own leases. Demonstrated through the executor, exit 0.
    #   -O          `git grep -O<cmd>` runs <cmd> as the pager over the
    #               matches. `grep` is a *read* verb, so unlike rebase this one
    #               needs no lease and no file on the volume: one call, and the
    #               value is attached to the flag rather than separated, which
    #               is why the matcher below has to handle the attached form.
    #   --trailer   `git commit -m msg --trailer <name>:<value>` runs
    #               `trailer.<name>.cmd` to compute the value, so the payload
    #               lands on `commit` — the argv the skills already send, and
    #               the one the design doc calls reachable with no unusual
    #               argument at all. The key's arbitrary name puts it out of
    #               reach of the pins. Measured under the pinned environment
    #               against git 2.55: `git config trailer.zz.cmd 'id #'` then
    #               `git commit -m msg --trailer zz:v` writes the credential
    #               container's `uid=` into the commit message. It has no short
    #               form on either subcommand that accepts it.
    #   --help      `git <any-verb> --help` is not a usage message: it is
    #               dispatched to the same viewer `git help` uses, so it runs
    #               `man.<man.viewer>.cmd` through a shell. Refusing the `help`
    #               subcommand does not touch it, because the verb in argv is
    #               `status`. Measured under the pinned environment against git
    #               2.55, with `man.viewer`/`man.evil.cmd` set repository-locally:
    #               `git commit --help`, `git status --help`, `git version --help`
    #               and `git log --help` all execute the configured command. The
    #               `status` spelling is the cheapest path in this file — a read
    #               verb, so no lease is taken anywhere in the sequence, and
    #               `status` is squarely on the shipped path.
    #
    #               `-h` is NOT refused and must not be: git answers it from the
    #               subcommand's own option table and prints usage without
    #               dispatching to a viewer. Verified — `git status -h` prints
    #               `usage: git status ...` with the payload configured.
    #               `--help` also takes no abbreviation (`git status --hel` is
    #               `error: unknown option`), so this one literal entry is the
    #               whole closure.
    #

    spellings than the executor accepts is a parser differential — the one
    kind of bug this policy layer keeps producing.

    1. `--flag=value`, handled by splitting on the first `=`.
    2. `-Ovalue` and `-iOvalue`, the attached and clustered short forms,
       handled by `_GIT_REFUSED_SHORT` against every letter in the token.
    3. **`--fl`, an abbreviation.** git's *subcommand* options go through
       parse-options, which accepts any unambiguous prefix, so `git rebase
       --exe <cmd>` and `git config --glo alias.zz '!<cmd>'` both run. Both

    strictly more conservative than git: git takes a prefix only when it is
    unambiguous among the options that subcommand defines, and this does not
    know the subcommand. Deliberately so — deciding ambiguity here would mean
    reimplementing parse-options and agreeing with it forever. The cost is
    refusing `--g`, `--ex` and the like as literal arguments, which nothing
    sends. Note the direction: `--oneline` is *not* refused, because it is not
    a prefix of anything on the list; only `--o` and `--op` would be.

    This switch is deliberately not documented in the customer-facing reference.
    It is global, unscoped and has no expiry: setting it disables the read-only
    posture for every command, every agent and every cluster in the Pod, and
    today there is no impersonation layer underneath to catch what gets through
    (see command_policy's module docstring).

    **On an operator-managed install there is no supported way to set it, by
    design.** The operator reserves the name: a `spec.deployment.env` entry is
    rejected by the validating webhook and dropped by mergeCredentialProxyEnv,
    no ConfigMap carries it, and a hand edit to the generated Deployment is
    reverted on the next reconcile. Whoever can edit the PlatformAgent is
    frequently who the policy is meant to constrain, so the switch is not
    theirs. An earlier version of this docstring offered it as the way to
    "recover from a bad allowlist without waiting on an image build"; that
    route did not exist -- the ConfigMap it named has only ever carried
    policy.json -- and following it during an outage costs an operator a CR
    patch that changes nothing and explains nothing.

    The remedy for a command the allowlist should have permitted is to add it
    to command_policy.KUBECTL_READ_VERBS or GCLOUD_READ_COMMANDS and ship the
    image, which is what the customer-facing reference already tells the
    reader to do (docs/site/.../reference/credential-isolation.md).

    What remains is the process environment, which is how the tests arm and
    disarm the gate and how the proxy behaves when run outside the operator --
    a standalone or local invocation, where the person setting it is the
    person running the process.

        Every response here is content or a name. Nothing returns a filesystem
        path, because a path handed back is a directory the agent can be told to
        `cd` into — which is precisely the arrangement this replaces. The
        `handle` is a broker-minted opaque token, not a location. That holds for
        the error responses too: `ContentWorkspaceStore._redact` takes every
        absolute path, plus the handle, back out of git's stderr before it goes
        on the wire. That is the only reason the sentence above is a property
        rather than an intention, and it scrubs by shape rather than by a list
        of known paths -- the leak nobody predicted is the failure mode here.

        These routes deliberately do **not** go through `Policy.blocked_by`,
        `git_argument_violation` or `git_lease_violation`. Those three inspect an
        argv the caller composed; here the caller composes no argv at all. The
        equivalent controls are structural: `content_workspace.repo_relative`
        decides what a path may name, `CommandExecutor.execute_workspace_git`
        decides which git may run, and neither reads a caller string into a
        command position.
