# This module must not spawn a subprocess at import. platform_mcp_server.py
# imports it, so module scope runs twice per platform-profile kanban worker
# spawn — once in the agent_common MCP child (deploy/shared/defaults/config.yaml)
# and once in platform_control (agents/platform/config.yaml) — and once more per
# pod in session_kv_server, which the entrypoint backgrounds as uvicorn
# (deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh step 5) rather than starting per worker.
# Spawning from here therefore buys an extra sandboxed interpreter start on
# every worker, which under gVisor is the dominant per-process cost.
#
# A former load_slack_token() shelled out to `kubectl get secret
# platform-agent-secrets` here. It could not populate SLACK_BOT_TOKEN on either
# path, and the two paths fail for different reasons:
#   - In the MCP children, _build_safe_env withholds CREDENTIAL_PROXY_URL, so
#     the PATH kubectl shim exits 1 (credential_proxy_client.py).
#   - In session_kv_server, which inherits the full pod env, the shim does reach
#     the credential-proxy sidecar and is rejected there: the process cwd is
#     /opt/hermes, outside CREDENTIAL_PROXY_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/opt/data (see
#     _within_workspace in credential_proxy.py, and docker-entrypoint.sh step
#     5.5, which already records the cwd).
# No reader of the variable depends on this having populated it, because each
# consults a config file before the environment:
# platform_mcp_server.get_enabled_platforms reads CONFIG_PATH first, and
# session_kv_server.enabled_chat_platforms and chat_platforms.enabled_chat_platforms
# both read the managed scope (/etc/hermes/config.yaml) first and CONFIG_PATH
# second, falling through to the environment per platform only where neither file
# says. Do not maintain that as a count — it has been wrong once already. Pinned by
# TestNoSubprocessAtImport in test_agent_common_server.py.

    This hands the child *the caller's entire environment*. That is safe today,
    but it is safe because of two facts outside this file rather than anything
    this function does, and both are worth stating because the day either stops
    holding, every call site here becomes a credential leak at once.

    1. The sandbox container holds no credentials. The operator gives it exactly
       two Secret-backed variables — SESSION_KV_API_KEY and SESSION_KV_SALT,
       both pod-scoped: neither authenticates nor pseudonymises anything outside
       this Pod. Its API_SERVER_KEY is the non-secret sentinel
       `cluster-internal-trusted`, and the real credentials live in the
       credential-proxy container. See docs/credential-isolation-design.md,
       "The loopback-only exception", which owns this and is the page to change
       if it moves. The allowlist is enforced on the Go side by
       TestBuildDeployment in platformagent_manifests_test.go, and pinned here
       by TestRunEnvInheritanceContract in test_agent_common_server.py, which
       also covers the envFrom bulk-mount the Go loop cannot see.

    2. No call site crosses a privilege boundary. Callers are either an MCP
       child, whose own environment Hermes has already narrowed to an allowlist
       (`_build_safe_env` in hermes tools/mcp_tool.py, and the `env:` blocks in
       agents/platform/config.yaml), or session_kv_server spawning `hermes send`
       as the same UID in the same container — a child that could read
       /proc/self/environ anyway. Note that session_kv_server has two shapes:
       the uvicorn instance the entrypoint backgrounds holds the whole container
       environment, while the fallback instance platform_mcp_server spawns
       inherits the stdio MCP allowlist instead, which names SESSION_KV_API_KEY
       and not the salt. Narrower, so the argument holds either way — but do not
       read this docstring as a promise that the salt is always present.

    A new caller that spawns across a UID or container boundary, or a third
    variable added to the sandbox's Secret allowlist, invalidates this. Narrow
    the environment explicitly at that call site rather than reaching for this.
