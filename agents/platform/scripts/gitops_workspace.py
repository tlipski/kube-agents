"""One private git clone per concurrent operation, so agents stop stomping.

The pod does not run in a checkout. `hermes run` starts an agent in its profile
directory, and nothing clones the GitOps repository — so every `git` the skills
issued was landing outside a working tree. This module establishes the clone
lazily, on the first run that needs it.

Why the clone is *leased*
-------------------------
The first version of this file put every repository at one flat path, a pure
function of `owner/name`. That is exactly one working tree for the whole pod,
and the pod runs many agents at once: six audit crons, plus every kanban worker
the dispatcher spawns, plus whatever the operator is doing interactively. In the
incident that prompted this design, the `submit-suggestion` skill ran
`git checkout -b …` and `git push -f` inside the tree a fleet audit was midway
through using, because neither skill named a directory and both defaulted to the
same one.

Serialising that with a lock cannot work, for two independent reasons:

* The window that needs protecting spans processes. A fleet audit writes its
  remediation manifests into the tree *between* `audit_report.py start` and
  `audit_report.py finish` — minutes apart, two separate invocations. An
  `fcntl.flock` fd dies with the process that opened it, so it cannot span them.
* Even if it could, serialising is the wrong answer. Concurrent work by
  different agents is the steady state here, not an anomaly; a ten-minute audit
  must not block an interactive provisioning request.

So each concurrent operation takes a **lease** and gets its own clone under it:

    <root>/<lease>/<owner>__<name>

The lease is a caller-chosen, stable string — the audit id for a fleet audit
stream, the kanban task id for a dispatcher-spawned worker. Being stable is what
lets `start` and `finish` find the same tree with no lookup state; being
per-operation is what keeps two operations out of each other's way. Nobody
waits on anybody.

`<root>/<lease>/.lease` records who holds it. It is the reaper's TTL anchor (its
mtime is refreshed on every `ensure_workspace`), the marker the credential proxy
looks for before it will run a tree-mutating `git`, and the record a client
checks before writing in a tree that might not be its own.

Everything here runs through an injected `runner` so the caller's logging, error
handling and credential proxying apply unchanged, and so the existing test
harness sees these calls like any other.
