"""Unit tests for github_scan_gate.py, the ``github-repo-watcher`` dispatcher.

Run: python3 -m unittest agents/platform/scripts/test_github_scan_gate.py

Three properties carry the weight here.

The first is that **an idle tick is silent on stdout**. Stdout is the delivery
channel: the scheduler posts whatever this job prints, so a stray line turns a
ten-minute poll into 144 chat messages a day. That is the failure the whole
gate exists to avoid, so it is asserted directly rather than inferred from "no
card was filed".

The second is that **silence and fault stay apart** — the same distinction
``test_resolver.py`` protects one layer down. ``NO_ISSUES`` and
``NOT_CONFIGURED`` are supported states; a resolver that cannot run is not, and
must reach the room. A gate that flattened the two would make a broken watcher
indistinguishable from a quiet repository.

The third is **sweep isolation**. Consolidating two cron jobs into one script
gave up the isolation two jobs had for free, and the ``try`` per sweep is what
buys it back. If a raising sweep could abort the loop, the consolidation would
have traded a token saving for a single point of failure.
